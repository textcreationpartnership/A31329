            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>WHen all things were full of Hatred and Diſſention (eſpecially thoſe Princes to whom was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of God almoſt the whole Government of things,<note place="margin">Vide Diplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma in Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lario, <hi>p. 667.</hi>
                  </note> differing among themſelves) when the Unity of the Name of Chriſt was now almoſt pull'd and torn to pieces with Schiſms and Hereſies, <hi>Paul</hi> III. of Sacred Memory, willing to put a ſtop to thoſe ſo great Evils, in the Year of the Incarnation of our Lord 1537. appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a General Council at <hi>Mantua;</hi> but beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and by the ſuggeſtion of the Prince of Darkneſs, the City <hi>Mantua</hi> could not be granted the Church for this purpoſe, unleſs upon certain Conditions very far from the Reaſons of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Dignity and Liberty, which for juſt Reaſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not yielded to, 'twas neceſſary to make choice of
<pb facs="tcp:63052:3"/> another Place. Nor did any ſeem more fit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient than <hi>Vincentia,</hi> a City large enough indeed, and under the Authority and Power of the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who granted it, being both Safe and convenient to all: Wherefore thither a General Council is call'd, to begin on the Kalends of <hi>May,</hi> 1538. in the mean while the Pope endeavor'd to reconcile <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor and <hi>Francis</hi> King of <hi>France;</hi> and therefore He and both thoſe Princes came to <hi>Nice,</hi> their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors being ſent before to <hi>Vincentia</hi> to prepare for the Council. There could be no Peace conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed betwixt the Emperor and the King, but only a Truce was agreed upon for ten years. Now hitherto the Council was once and again appointed, and put off almoſt Three whole Years; which time being ſpent, the Holy Pope, impatient at the loſs of ſo many Souls, altering the Place, and having choſen the City of <hi>Trent,</hi> at the Requeſt of the <hi>Germans</hi> eſpecially, there he anew denounces a Council to be held on the Kalends of <hi>November,</hi> in the Year of the Incarnation of our Lord 1542.</p>
               <p>A Bull was no ſooner ſent to the Princes, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily freſh War is vigorouſly purſu'd between the Emperor and the French King, whence a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Diſturbances ariſing on every ſide, the Council could not be begun before the Thirteenth day of <hi>December, Anno Dom.</hi> 1645. In the mean time it was wonderful to behold how greatly <hi>Luther</hi>'s Hereſie crept abroad; and Impiety, the Child of War, had overſpread almoſt all <hi>Europe,</hi> and there ſcarcely remain'd ſo much as the bare Shadow of Religion. Now to take away and reform theſe Evils, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from all Parts haſten together to <hi>Trent;</hi> but, Good God! the Work appears Infinit, and in the Lake <hi>Lerna,</hi> there is not only one <hi>Hydra</hi> to be cut
<pb facs="tcp:63052:3"/> off, but the Work requires many Hands; which that the Fathers might furniſh with Arms, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to inform the Curats, who at that time were almoſt all void of both Learning and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that thereupon the ignorant Vulgar might the more eaſily be taught. Now concerning the Way and Manner of holding this Divine Council, it was afterwards long and diligently debated: The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers met: There were made by the Heretics not only vaſt Volumes,<note place="margin">Vid. Ind. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brorum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they endeavor'd to overthrow the Catholic Faith; but alſo there were written almoſt infinit Books by them, which carrying in them the Titles and Shews of Piety and Religion, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible how hard it was to diſcern the good Seed of Chriſt from the Tares of the Enemy; and there were as many Catechiſms carried about, as there are Provinces in <hi>Europe,</hi> yea, and almoſt as many as there are Cities; all which abounded with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, and wherewith the Minds of the Simple eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where were deceiv'd; and ſcarcely was there any one well grounded in the Faith. <hi>Wherefore the Fathers of the General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of</hi> Trent,<note place="margin">The Preface of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm, p. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>being earneſtly deſirous to apply ſome wholeſom Remedy to this ſo great and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Evil, thought it not enough to determin ſome of the Points of Catholic Doctrin againſt the Hereſies of our Times; but held it further neceſſary, to appoint ſome certain Way and Rule of Inſtructing Chriſtian People in the Rudiments of Faith; which in all Churches they are to obſerve, to whom is lawfully committed the Charge of Paſtor and Teacher.</hi> Obſerve, O ye Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and own this your Book, foraſmuch as it was not only undertaken and publiſh'd for your ſakes; but alſo the Uſe of it, by the very Council,
<pb facs="tcp:63052:4"/> is thus appointed you. <hi>That the Faithful may come with the greater Reverence and Devotion of Mind to the Receiving the Sacraments,</hi>

                  <hi>this Holy Synod commands all Biſhops, That not only when the Sacraments are to be miniſtred to the People by themſelves, they firſt explain the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Vertue of them, according to the Capacity of the Receivers; but alſo, if there be need, and if it can conveniently be done, that they endeavor the ſame may be piouſly and prudently obſerv'd by all Curats, even in the Vulgar Tongue, <hi>According to a Form to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Holy Synod, in a Catechiſm concerning all the Sacraments,</hi> which the Biſhops ſhall take care to have faithfully tranſlated into the Vulgar Tongue, and by all Curats to be explain'd to the People, &amp;c.</hi> From whence it appears, for what Reaſon, and for whoſe ſake, the Holy Synod of <hi>Trent</hi> Decreed this Holy Work to be publiſh'd: And from what was before cited, it is not darkly hinted, that even from the very beginning of the Council, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers foreſaw it to be very neceſſary, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, or at leaſt, which is very certain, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the Eighteenth Seſſion, which was the Second under Pope <hi>Pius</hi> IV. That this Sacred Work ſhould be compos'd, S. <hi>Charles Borromaeus</hi> then procuring, and with incredible diligence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting whatſoever was profitable for Reformation of Manners: For when it was there decreed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Choice of Books, and certain Fathers were choſen for that purpoſe, That all pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſuſpected Books ſhould be ſet aſide and prohibited by the Council, it is not to be doubted, that it was at the ſame time decreed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Remedy to be apply'd to that poſtiferous Doctrin, <hi>i. e.</hi> concerning the publiſhing our Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm;
<pb facs="tcp:63052:4"/> and that there were ſome Fathers choſen, which we ſhall name by and by, to labor in ſo great a Work. This plainly appears from the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Twenty fifth Seſſion, where it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed concerning the Index of Books, and making our Catechiſm: For thus it ſays;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Holy Synod celebrated in the Second Seſſion under our moſt Holy Lord Pope</hi> Pius IV. <hi>has commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to certain Fathers choſen for that end, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of what is fit to be done concerning di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Cenſures and Books, either ſuſpected or pernicious, and to make Relation thereof to the Holy Synod. Now underſtanding that the whole Work is finiſhed, and yet that by reaſon of the variety and multitude of Books, the Holy Synod cannot diſtinctly and conveniently judge of them, She commands that whatſoever has been done by them, be exhibited to his Holineſs the Pope, that it may be determin'd and publiſh'd by his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Authority; and commands the ſame to be done about the Catechiſm, by the Fathers to whom it was committed, and about the Miſſal and Breviary.</hi> From theſe things it manifeſtly appears, firſt, Why the Synod of <hi>Trent</hi> commanded this Form of Catechiſm to be publiſh'd: Secondly, When it Decreed it: Thirdly, That this Catechiſm is of ſo great Authority, that it ought to be preferr'd before all others: Fourthly, That it ought never to be out of the Hands of the Paſtors; for to them it is a Storehouſe of true Divinity, and a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſull of all Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline.</p>

                  <hi>ARTICLE. II.</hi> To what Fathers the Care of the Catechiſm was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and how long they labor'd about it.</head>
               <p>IT may be ſaid, that the Fathers labor'd in this Catechiſm two ſeveral times: Firſt, While they were at <hi>Trent,</hi> in Council, <hi>i. e.</hi> for almoſt Two whole Years, to wit, from the Eighteenth Seſſion celebrated the Twenty ſixth day of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> 1562. till the end of the Synod, which was finiſh'd in the Month of <hi>December,</hi> 1563. The laſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> when the Sacred Aſſembly was diſmiſs'd, at <hi>Rome,</hi> whither certain Fathers choſen for this end, were conven'd together, and continu'd in this Work above Three Years, to wit, from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the Council, to the Year 1556. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Work being finiſh'd, was offer'd to Pope <hi>Pius</hi> V. of Sacred Memory, to be approv'd: Whence it was, that for Five full Years the Fathers who among the reſt were moſt Devout and Learn'd, and therefore choſen by the Council, labor'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether both in Compoſing and Perfecting this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm; which conſidering well of, verily we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judge him by any means to be of a ſound Mind, that thinks not ſuch a Book as this worthy of all eſteem, and to be had in reverence in all Ages; and they that in diſputing of Matters of Divinity, if this Catechiſm be cited, reject it in ſcorn, as fit for Children, we ſhould think to be very unſound and in the dark. But to come to the Fathers: It is certain from the Laſt Seſſion, that for the Two laſt Years of the Council, there were very many excellent Divines choſen out
<pb facs="tcp:63052:5"/> of the whole Aſſembly of Fathers, that beſtow'd much Pains and great Labor on this Catechiſm: For the Matter of it is divided into certain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, which being then diſtributed amongſt them, every one took care and labor'd in his own, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Intent of the Council, and the Senſe of the Church, <hi>as the Spirit gave them utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi> That this was thus done, <hi>Chriſtopher San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorius,</hi> of the Order of Hermits of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> teſtifies, who ſays, That this Particle of the Creed, <hi>[And in One Holy Catholic Church,]</hi> was committed to Cardinal <hi>Seripandus,</hi> of the ſame Order, to be explain'd. But that the Fourth Article of the Creed was aſſign'd to <hi>Michael Medina,</hi> of the Order of <hi>Friers Minors,</hi> appears from himſelf, who attributed it to himſelf, in the Preface to his <hi>Opuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum</hi> concerning the ſame Fourth Article of the Creed: From <hi>Poſſevinus, in Apparatu, Lit. P.</hi> we learn, that <hi>Peter Galeſinus</hi> expounded in Latin that part of this Catechiſm wherein are explain'd God's Commandments; and <hi>ibid. Lit. I.</hi> he aſſerts, That <hi>Julius Spogianus</hi> expounded the laſt Head of this Catechiſm; the ſame thing <hi>Caſtalio</hi> diſtinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms in theſe Words: <hi>In Writing of the Catechiſm which was made by the Decree of the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>&amp; publiſh'd by Command of Pope</hi> Pius V. <hi>there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Divines and Learn'd Men that labor'd.</hi> Delius Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualinus, <hi>a very grave Man, aſſur'd me, that the Creed, or at leaſt a part of the Creed, was given to</hi> Antonianus <hi>to be explain'd; which I alſo found in his Adverſaries.</hi>

               <p>Therefore, O ye Paſtors, mark, I beſeech you! Not only the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> took Pains in this Work, as ſome have dream'd, that they might leſſen the Authority of it, as tho it were not the Work of the Univerſal Church, but of
<pb facs="tcp:63052:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſome peculiar Theological Sect, wherein they caſt no ſmall Note of Infamy upon the Council and Pope.</p>
               <p>But paſſing by the Holy Council, which was over the whole Work, we deny not that it was committed to ſome Fathers of the Order of Friers Preachers: But from this very thing, that they undertook the doing of this Office by the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Appointment, it is manifeſt, that they freely laid aſide their own proper and peculiar Senſe and Opinion, if ſuch they had; or that it was enjoyn'd them either by the Decree of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, or by the Command of the Pope, by word of Mouth, to handle all things, not according to their own, but according to the Churches Senſe; otherwiſe it had been imprudently done; which to aſſert, how wicked would it be? Now the ſaid Fathers were theſe: I. <hi>Leonardus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi> of <hi>Genua,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Lancia.</hi> II. <hi>Giles Fuſcararius</hi> of <hi>Bullen,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Mutinum.</hi> III. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Foretius</hi> of <hi>Liſbon,</hi> a Divine of the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s in the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> All which, of how great Piety, of how great Learning, and of how great Renown they were, for their very many Eccleſiaſtical Gifts and Functions, both in the very Synod and out of it, S. <hi>Charles Borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus,</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Staniſlaus Hoſius</hi> Cardinal <hi>Vivarin.</hi> ſays enough alone to ſatisfie me, that they were the moſt Learn'd among the Fathers of the Council: And <hi>Joſeph Ripalmontius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms my Belief of the ſame thing, when he ſays thus: <hi>He</hi> (he means S. <hi>Charles</hi>) <hi>conceiv'd in his Mind that great Work of the</hi> Roman <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm, concerning the Performance of which Work, the Fathers</hi> (<hi>at</hi> Trent) <hi>made a Decree, and that
<pb facs="tcp:63052:6"/> Decree was extant among the reſt; and even the greateſt Divines labor'd together in compoſing it, and diſpoſing the Heads of it. But this was S.</hi> Charles<hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign too, that the Divinity and Heigth of the Matters and Sentences therein might be explain'd by like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Words; for that purpoſe making uſe of ſuch Men as were moſt Excellent for the Latin Tongue, by them to finiſh a Work which might ſeem to be made for ſome better Age of</hi> Romans <hi>than the preſent Storm bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> From which it is manifeſt, that the Praiſe of this Work is in no ſmall meaſure due to S. <hi>Charles</hi> himſelf: Which is alſo plain from the Epiſtle of the ſame Saint to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> of whom he begs leave, after the Diſmiſſion of the Council, to retain <hi>Francis Foretius,</hi> becauſe he would be very neceſſary to the Church, for the compleating of this Catechiſm. But tho the Glory of this whole Sacred Work ſeems to be due to theſe Fathers, yet nevertheleſs we muſt truly and deſervedly acknowledge, that we have receiv'd it from Pope <hi>Pius</hi> V. of Sacred Memory, as from the Firſt Mover; and if there be need of Witneſs in this Caſe, we have <hi>Gabutin,</hi> who in the Life of that Pope ſays thus: <hi>He took care that the Sacred Catechiſm for the Curats,</hi>

                  <hi>wherein are contain'd the Chief Heads of Catholic Doctrin, clearly explain'd by Men famous for Chriſtian Eloquence and Learning, ſhould be made Latin, and be publiſh'd every where, firſt in Latin, and then render'd into the Italian, French, German, and Polonian Language.</hi> Now ſince things, as to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Catechiſm, are ſo, what, I pray, are we to think? Of what worth is it? Of what Authority is it? The General Council decreed it to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd, and diſtributed to certain choſen Fathers,
<pb facs="tcp:63052:7"/> every part of the Matter of it to be treated upon; and of all thoſe Tracts by them made, by the Pope's Command and S. <hi>Charles</hi>'s Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the Work and Buſineſs is finiſh'd and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, by Men beſt skill'd in all kind of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whoſe Vertue, Learning, and Piety was well known to the Univerſal Church. Can we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore find any other Book, next to the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Scripture, that we can hold more dear to us, and which deſerves to be more look'd into?</p>

                  <hi>ARTICLE. III.</hi> By whom this Catechiſm was approv'd.</head>
               <p>BEfore this Catechiſm came forth into Light, tho there had labor'd in it ſo Many and ſo Great Men, tho it had been read again and again, and compleated by the Care and Induſtry of S. <hi>Charles;</hi> yet being offer'd to <hi>Pius</hi> V. of Holy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, that at laſt he ſhould eſtabliſh it by his Supreme Authority, that Supreme Biſhop would not have it go forth from him, before it ſhould again be review'd by other Doctors, that this Univerſal Book being publiſh'd with that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity and Prudence which was fit, it might be univerſally receiv'd. The Matter was committed to <hi>William Sirlet</hi> Cardinal, as one whoſe Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Piety he very well knew; and which the Pope could not but be acquainted with, by thoſe other Cardinals, not a few, that were lately Aſſiſtants with S. <hi>Charles.</hi> That ſo Great Man, by Command of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> V. took to him certain Divines choſen out of the reſt, who
<pb facs="tcp:63052:7"/> might ſift and ſearch narrowly into, not only the Dogms or Doctrins of this Book, but alſo the very Words; which being finiſh'd with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Induſtry and Sollicitude of that truly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable and Faithful Paſtor, the Pope approv'd it, and coming forth at <hi>Rome</hi> intire, that it might paſs every where elſe pure and uncorrupt, he commanded it to be printed by <hi>Manutius,</hi> to be perfectly purg'd from all Miſtakes, and ſo to be publiſh'd. It is worth the while to conſider the Popes own Words, and they are theſe, <hi>Of our own Motion and Paſtoral Duty deſiring, as earneſtly as we can, by the Aſſiſtance of Gods Grace to perform and injoyn thoſe things which were decreed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by the Sacred Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>we have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that a Catechiſm might be compos'd by choſen Divines in this fair City, whereby the Faithful Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt, may by the diligence of their Curats, be taught concerning thoſe things which they muſt know, profeſs and obſerve: which Book, when by Gods Aſſiſtance it was perfected, and to be brought forth into Light, we took care to provide that it might be print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with all the Diligence and Faithfulneſs that could be. In this fair City therefore we would firſt of all have it printed, by the Diligence of our beloved Son</hi> Paul Manutius, <hi>who is us'd here to print other Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Books. Now becauſe if it ſhould be printed elſwhere, it might happen that a Book of ſuch an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument might be printed with leſs care and fidelity than is fit; for this Reaſon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Dated at</hi> Rome <hi>at S.</hi> Mark 7 <hi>of the Kalends of October, in the firſt Year,</hi> &amp;c. From hence it is plain how much the Pope made of this Book, and with how great Care it was to be Printed; and indeed as often as hereafter it is to be Printed, the Biſhops ought
<pb facs="tcp:63052:8"/> to take Care from the Example of ſo great a Pope that it be not fill'd with as many Faults as there are Lines in it.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore Pope <hi>Pius</hi> V. not only by his own proper Motion approv'd this Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm,<note place="margin">In Bull. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> but moreover he commended it, and commanded it to be us'd as often as any thing was to be done about Amendment of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners or Reformation of Orders. See his 102 Bull publiſh'd <hi>Anno</hi> 1580. for Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the <hi>Ciſtercian</hi> Order;<note place="margin">Ibid. p. <hi>307.</hi>
                  </note> as alſo his 105 Bull publiſh'd the ſame Year, about reducing the Congregation of the Servants of the Bleſſed <hi>Mary</hi> to a better State; as alſo his 106 publiſh'd the ſame Year alſo about the Amendment of the <hi>Miſſal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second by whom this Sacred Work was approv'd, was <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. Succeſſor to <hi>Pius</hi> V. who in a certain Breve of the Year 1583 declares, That by his Command and Approbation, the Catechiſm was lately publiſh'd; and this Pope ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted this Book ſo truly profitable, that by his peculiar Mandate he commanded it to be tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the <hi>Sclavonian</hi> Language, as appears by the Council of <hi>Algar,</hi> by and by to be cited, and moreover, as <hi>Poſſevine</hi> teſtifies, this Catechiſm was to him as a certain Rule, whereby he thought that the Canon Law it ſelf may be reformed: For which cauſe he perſwaded <hi>Francis Gracian,</hi> one of the Treaſurers and Canon of S. <hi>Vincent,</hi> to publiſh an Epitome of the Canon Law; wherein he ſhould pare away whatſoever had been abrogated either by the Popes, or by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> or by the Roman Catechiſm.</p>
               <p>The Third that approv'd this our Catechiſm
<pb facs="tcp:63052:8"/> was St. <hi>Charles Borromaeus,</hi> who not only in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cited Epiſtles; but alſo eſpecially in this Firſt Synod which he had at <hi>Millan Anno</hi> 1565. where he commanded all Clerks, after that they ſhould attain to their Tenth Year, diligently to read this Catechiſm.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the ſame Catechiſm was approv'd in the Synod of <hi>Beneventum, Anno</hi> 1567. where it is injoyn'd to all, both Curats and Preachers of Gods Word, that for the Diſcharge of their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, they frequently have in their Hands that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm, which was publiſh'd by the Pope's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that they may be able to teach all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſound Doctrin, and which the Chuch approves.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, it was approved in the Synod of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna</hi> 1568. and there under the Title <hi>de Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nario c.</hi> 4. it wonderfully commends this Book, which it calls the Catechiſm of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and commands thoſe that are in Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to have it always before them.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, it was again approv'd by St. <hi>Charles</hi> in the Synod of <hi>Millan Anno</hi> 1569. and there it is commanded the Curats, that they frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handle among themſelves ſome Reading of the Roman Catechiſm.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, it was approv'd in the Synod of <hi>Meaux</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> which was held <hi>Anno</hi> 1569. and thus decreed <hi>Conſtit.</hi> 26. <hi>The Curats in thoſe things which belong to their Miniſtry, even as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops when they are to adminiſter the Sacraments to the People, ought to explain the Vertue and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of them in our vulgar German Tongue according to the Capacity of the Receivers, according to what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Roman Catechiſm, a Book truly very
<pb facs="tcp:63052:9"/> profitable, and very neceſſary for theſe Times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eighthly, it was approv'd again a Third Time by St. <hi>Charles</hi> in a Synod of <hi>Millan Anno</hi> 1571. wherein it is commanded, that the Curats in the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments make uſe of the Doctrin of the Roman Catechiſm.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, it was approv'd in the Synod at <hi>Genua, Anno</hi> 1574. <hi>Tit. de Fidei elementis à Parocho tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tenthly, it was approv'd a Fourth Time by St. <hi>Charles</hi> in a Synod at <hi>Millan Anno</hi> 1576. where among thoſe Books which the Curat ought to exhibit to the Biſhop at Viſitation, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catechiſm is appointed to be one.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, it was approv'd alſo a Fifth Time by the ſame St. <hi>Charles</hi> in a Synod at <hi>Millan An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1579. where concerning the way of Examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is commanded that enquiry be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe that are to be Ordain'd, <hi>Whether they have the Roman Catechiſm, and hold the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Twelfthly, it was approv'd the ſame Year by the Clergy of all <hi>France,</hi> in a Synod at <hi>Melun,</hi> wherein many places, but eſpecially under thoſe Four Titles, of Baptiſm, Euchariſt, Penance and Order, this Catechiſm, which there is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> it is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the Curats, that by that Catholic Aſſembly of all the Clergy, it is judged alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether neceſſary for them, and to be preferr'd before all others; for thus it is ſaid there, <hi>The Curats are bound to teach their Flocks according to the Preſcription of the Catechiſm of the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>as purely and ſimply as may be.</hi> And elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>For the due Performance of which matter</hi> (to
<pb facs="tcp:63052:9"/> wit, in exhorting the People, <hi>uſing the common Places of the Roman Catechiſm, and the Doctrin of the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>concerning all the Sacraments, which for that end is ſtudiouſly and accurately to be read by all Curats.</hi> Moreover, <hi>Let the Confeſſors as exactly as may be, follow the Rules and Precepts of the Catechiſm of</hi> Trent <hi>in things of this ſort, and in exerciſing Works of Piety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirteenthly, it was approv'd in the Synod of <hi>Roan</hi> in <hi>Normandy Anno</hi> 1581. Where it was thus ordered. <hi>Now that every Curat may diſcharge his Office, let him have the Roman Catechiſm in Latin and French, c.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>Fourteenthly, in the Synod of <hi>Bourdeaux Anno.</hi> 1583. where it is thus, <hi>Let the Curats upon all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-days, teach the People ſomewhat out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm of</hi> Trent, <hi>which by our Authority we enjoyn them to have by them, both in Latin and French, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifteenthly, in the Synod of <hi>Tours Anno</hi> 1583. <hi>Tit. de profeſſione &amp; Fidei tuendae curae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixteenthly, in the Synod of <hi>Rhemes.</hi> 1583. <hi>Tit. de Curatis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventeenthly, in the Provincial Synod of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queia</hi> in <hi>France Anno</hi> 1585. <hi>Tit. de Parochis.</hi> Where it is thus, <hi>Now that every Curat may diſcharge his Office, let him have the Roman Catechiſm, both in Latin and French, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eighteenthly, in the Provincial Synod of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, Anno</hi> 1590. where it is thus, <hi>We enjoyn the Curats, that they have continually in their Hands the Catechiſm of the Council of</hi> Trent. <hi>Tit. de Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nineteenthly, in the Synod of <hi>Avignion Anno</hi> 1594. <hi>Tit. de Officio Parochi, Let them diligently uſe the Roman Catechiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb facs="tcp:63052:10"/>
               <p>Twentiethly, in the Synod of <hi>Aquileia Anno</hi> 1586. whereof before.</p>
               <p>I omit very many Dioceſan Synods, in which this our Catechiſm was approved.</p>
               <p>I omit alſo thoſe Doctors of very great Note, who aſſert, That next to the Canonical Books, there is nothing can be read with more Safety and Advantage, than this Catechiſm. Now theſe things, Friendly Reader, being premis'd, who can endure the Boldneſs of them, that deſpiſing this ſacred Work as a childiſh Toy, ſcorn to meddle with it, and that for this only Reaſon; becauſe it is call'd a Catechiſm? O miſerably blind Souls!</p>
               <p>But to make thoſe Men bluſh all over for Shame, I intreat them to hear <hi>Auguſtine Valerius</hi> Cardinal and Biſhop of <hi>Verona,</hi> a very dear Friend to St. <hi>Charles Borromaeus,</hi> and the Glory of the Sacred Colledge, in his Firſt Book, <hi>Ad Acolythos Veronenſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>This Catechiſm was publiſh'd Three Year ago, by Command of Pope</hi> Pius <hi>V. which we ſee to have been given of God, for the Benefit of the Chriſtian Common-wealth, and for the reſtoring to us the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient D ſcipline of the Church. A Work ſo excellent, if we regard the Gravity or Weight of the Sentences, and the clearneſs of the Words or Expreſſions, that Learned Men judg that there has nothing more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent been publiſh'd for theſe many Ages paſt. For all things are explain'd, which belong to the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of Souls, and that in ſo good an Order, and with ſo great Clearneſs and Majeſty, that our Holy Mother the Church, taught by the Holy Ghoſt, ſeems to teach all, and Men to hold their Peace. You that are ſomewhat aged, read this Catechiſm Seven times over and more than ſeven times; for thereby you will
<pb facs="tcp:63052:10"/> get great Advantage; for if in Hiſtory it be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, that</hi> Demoſthenes <hi>thorowly to commend Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, deſcrib'd</hi> Thucidides <hi>Eight times, and for that end, committed to Memory all his Orations ſo full of Arguments: how much fitter is it, that you, who are imploy'd in the Diſcipline of the Church, and ought to refer all your Studies to Gods Glory, and your own and others Salvation, ſhould diligently read, yea, and even to copy out Eight times over this moſt excellent Book, dictated by the Holy Ghoſt, written by the Decree of the Fathers that were preſent in the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>and publiſh'd by the Authority of Chriſt's Vicar?</hi>

               <p>THE Advantages of this Catechiſm of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> are ſo many, as the Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Church are; if Hereſie is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, that the Devil ſow it not, and that it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb not Catholics: Let the Curats often explain this Catechiſm. If Hereſie by an unlucky and ominous Birth, be already ſprung up and is to be ſtifled; let the Curats often explain this Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm: If Religion is to be preſerv'd uncorrupt and ſincere; let the Curats often explain this Catechiſm: If young Clerks, either in Seminaries, or privately, are to be prepared for the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of any Eccleſiaſtical Function; let this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm be often read to them: If any one be minded to adminiſter the Sacraments devoutly, as is fitting, and to the Edification of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors;
<pb facs="tcp:63052:11"/> let him have in his Hand this only Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm: Laſtly, if any Prieſt be minded to prepare himſelf to hear Confeſſions, to make Sermons, to direct Souls; let them uſe this only Catechiſm.</p>
               <p>For it is uſeful not in one reſpect only, as may eaſily be obſerved from what was before noted. I will here ſhew ſome of the more profitable.</p>
               <p>The Firſt way of uſing this Catechiſm is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd in almoſt all Synods, both Provincial and Dioceſan, which were had after the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> to wit, the daily reading thereof, or at leaſt ſo frequently, that whatſoever this Book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains may be kept in Memory.</p>
               <p>A Second way of uſing this ſacred Work, is commanded by St. <hi>Charles</hi> in his Second Synod at <hi>Millan</hi> before cited, to wit, that when the Curats of any Neighborhood come to meet each other, they ſhould frequently commune about ſome part of this Catechiſm; which is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a commendable Cuſtom and Uſage every Week in the Famous Presbytery of S. <hi>Nicholas de Cardineto</hi> in <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Third way of uſing this Catechiſm is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the ſame St. <hi>Charles</hi> in his Third Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod at <hi>Millan,</hi> where it is commanded, that as often as the Curats are to adminiſter any Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they teach and expound to the People the Points and Doctrin of this Book, the ſame is appointed in the Synod of <hi>Roan</hi> in <hi>Normandy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fourth way of uſing this Book is propos'd in the Synod of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> before cited, where it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that on all Holy-days the Curats teach the People out of this Catechiſm, ſome of thoſe things which it concerns all Chriſtians to know.</p>
               <p>The Fifth way is preſcrib'd in the Synod of
<pb facs="tcp:63052:11"/> 
                  <hi>Cremona Anno</hi> 1603. <hi>Pag.</hi> 9. in theſe words, <hi>By the Divine Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, thoſe Fathers that were in the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that as ſoon as may be the Roman Catechiſm might be written, out of which, as out of the moſt fruitful Breaſts of our Holy Mother, all the Clergy may ſuck the moſt ſweet Milk of the Church's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin.

               <hi>are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead.</hi> But that myſtery which was hid from all ages and generations, does ſo far ſurpaſs all humane underſtanding; that if it had not bin manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Saints, to whom it pleas'd God by the gift of faith to make known the riches of the glory of this myſtery, which is Chriſt, among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; it had bin impoſſible by any ſtudy or labor of man to aſpire to that wiſdom.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And indeed,<note place="margin">IV. God has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bin wanting to thoſe that are his. Heb. 1.1, 2. Iſa. 49.6. Heb. 12.25. 2 Pet. 1.17.</note> from the very beginning of the World, the moſt merciful and gracious God has never bin wanting to thoſe that are his: But by many and manifold ways, <hi>has ſpoken to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by the Prophets;</hi> and according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of times, has chalk'd them out a certain and direct way to celeſtial happineſs. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he foretold, he wou'd give <hi>a teacher of righteouſneſs, for a light of the Gentiles, and for ſalvation to the ends of the earth. He has laſt of all ſpoken to us by his Son,</hi> whom alſo by a voice ſent down from the moſt excellent glory,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.21.</note> he has commanded all to hear and obey his commands. And then the Son <hi>gave ſome Apoſtles, ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, ſome Paſtors and Teachers, to preach the word of life; that we may not be carry'd about as children, toſſed to and fro with every wind of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;</hi> but, ſticking cloſe to the firm foundation of faith, <hi>may be built together in the houſe of God, in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And leſt any one ſhou'd receiv the word of God from the miniſters of the Church,<note place="margin">V. How the paſtors of the Church ought to be heard.</note> as the word of men, and not as it is indeed, the word of Chriſt; our very Savior himſelf has appointed ſo great an authority to be given to their direction, that he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63052:13"/> ſays, <hi>He that bears you, bears me; and he that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſes you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luc. 10.25.</note> 
               <hi>deſpiſes me.</hi> Which yet he would not have to be underſtood of thoſe only, to whom he then ſpake; but alſo of all thoſe, who by a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſucceſſion, ſhou'd afterwards be receiv'd to the office of Teaching, with whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to <hi>be always preſent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 28.20.</note> 
               <hi>even to the end of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whereas the preaching of the divine word ought never to be intermitted in the Church,<note place="margin">VI. The neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods word.</note> ſo at this time with much greater piety and induſtry ought it to be endeavour'd, that with ſound and uncorrupt doctrine, as with the food of life, the Faithful ſhou'd be nouriſh'd and confirm'd. For there are falſe Prophets gone out into the world,<note place="margin">1 John 4.1.</note> of whom the Lord ſaid,<note place="margin">Jer. 23.11.</note> 
               <hi>I ſent not the Prophets, and yet they ran; I ſpake not to them, and yet they propheſi'd</hi> to corrupt the minds of Chriſtians by divers and ſtrange doctrines, wherein their wickedneſs, furniſh'd with all the arts of Satan, has proceeded ſo far, that it ſeems ſcarcely poſſible to be kept in any bounds. And, were we not confirm'd by that excellent and clear promiſe of our Savior, who affirms that he had laid the foundation of his Church ſo ſure,<note place="margin">Matt 16.28.</note> 
               <hi>that the gates of Hell ſhou'd never be able to prevail against her:</hi> It might at this time be very much fear'd, that being on every ſide beſet by her enemies, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd and try'd by ſo many engines and devices, ſhe ſhou'd utterly periſh.</p>
            <p>For,<note place="margin">VII. Hereſie breaking forth.</note> to omit thoſe moſt noble provinces and countries which heretofore have piouſly and holily embrac'd and retain'd that true catholic religion, which they received from their anceſtors or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, but now leaving the right way, have gone aſtray, and do openly profeſs their greateſt piety and religion to conſiſt in this, That they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and gone far away from the doctrine of their forefathers: There is no country, how remote ſoever, no place ſo well fortifi'd, there can no corner of Chriſt'ndom be found, whereinto this plague has not endeavour'd ſecretly to creep.</p>
            <p>For thoſe who intended with themſelves to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63052:14"/> the minds of the faithful,<note place="margin">VIII. By what arts ſhe ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered her errors.</note> knowing well, that they cou'd not have particular conference with all, to whiſper their venome into their ears; have gone another way to work, whereby they have much more eaſily and diffuſedly ſcatter'd the ſeeds of their impious errors. For beſides thoſe vaſt volumes wherewith they have endeavoured to overthrow the Catholic religion; whereof to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, there was no great need perhaps of any great pains or circumſpection, ſince they contain'd ſo manifeſt hereſie: they have alſo writt'n infinite books, which carrying in them a pretence of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; it is incredible how eaſily they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the unwary minds of the ſimple.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the fathers of the general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">IX. Why the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, Seſſ. 14. cap. 7. and Seſſ. 25. in the end, that this Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm ſhou'd be publiſh'd.</note> being earneſtly deſirous to apply ſome wholeſome remedy to this ſo great and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous evil, thought it not enough to determine the more weighty points of Catholic doctrine, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the hereſies of our times; but held it further neceſſary to appoint ſome certain way and rule of inſtructing Chriſtian people in the rudiments of faith: Which in all Churches they are to obſerve, to whom is lawfully committed the charge of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor and teacher.</p>
            <p>There have been many heretofore imploy'd in this kind of writing,<note place="margin">X. The autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and ſcope of this Catechiſm.</note> very commendable both for piety and learning. But yet the Fathers thought it wou'd be very uſeful, That a book ſhou'd be publiſh'd by authority of the holy Synod, whence the Curates, and all others to whom the office of teaching is committed, many find and fetch certain precepts and rules for the edification of the faithful; that as there is one God, and one faith; ſo alſo there may be one common rule and preſcript form of teaching Chriſtian people, all offices and duties of piety.</p>
            <p>Now there being ſo very many things which ſeem to belong to this matter;<note place="margin">XI. What it is this Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm treats of.</note> it is not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd therefore, that it was the deſign of the holy Synod to comprehend, and exactly explain all the dogms or opinions of Chriſtian faith in one book; which they are uſe to do, who profeſs to handle
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63052:14"/> all the whole doctrine and inſtitution of religion: For that wou'd be a labor almoſt endleſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed not ſo very ſuitable to the purpoſe: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the holy Synod intended to inſtruct only the Curats, and thoſe who have cure of Souls in the knowledg of thoſe things which moſt properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Paſtoral office, and accommodated to the capacity of the Faithful, ſhe undertook to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle thoſe things only, which might aſſiſt the pious endeavour of the Paſtors in this matter, if they have not bin ſo converſant and well skill'd in the more difficult diſputes of divine matters.</p>
            <p>Which things ſeeing they are ſo;<note place="margin">XII. What things are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in teaching.</note> before we come to handle thoſe things ſeverally, in which the ſum of this doctrin is contain'd; the order of our deſign requires, That ſome few things which Paſtors ought to conſider and lay before their eyes, ſhou'd be explain'd: That they may know whither as to the end, all their aim, labors and ſtudies are to be directed: And by what means they may the more eaſily compaſs and effect the thing they deſire.</p>
            <p>This therefore ſeems to be the chief, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,<note place="margin">XIII. The firſt.</note> That all Chriſtian knowledg or learning is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in this point; or rather, as our Savior ſays,<note place="margin">Joh. 17.3.</note> 
               <hi>This is life eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent</hi> Wherefore the labor of a Preacher in the church, ought eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be imployed in this, That the faithful may earneſtly, and from the very bottom of their ſouls deſire <hi>to know Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucifi'd,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.2.</note> and moſt aſſuredly perſwade themſelves, and with the deepeſt affection and devotion of heart believe,<note place="margin">Acts 4.2.</note> 
               <hi>That there is no other name under Heav'n given to men whereby they muſt be ſav'd; For he is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe <hi>hereby we know that we know him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">XIV. The ſecond. 1 Joh. 2.3.</note> 
               <hi>if we keep his commandments;</hi> the next thing, and, as we have already ſaid, very cloſely join'd with it, is, That he alſo evidence, that the faithful ought not to lead their life in ſloth and idleneſs;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.6.</note> but that <hi>we ought ſo to walk, even as Chriſt walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> and that with our utmoſt endeavors we shou'd
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63052:15"/> 
               <hi>follow after juſtice, godlineſs, faith, charity, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 2.14.</note> For, <hi>he gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie to himſelf an acceptable people, zealous of good works:</hi> Which the Apoſtle commands the Paſtors to teach and exhort.</p>
            <p>But whereas our Lord and Savior has not only ſaid,<note place="margin">XV. T e third. Matt. 22.40. 1 Tim. 1.5. Rom. 13 18.</note> but by his own example has alſo evidenc'd, That <hi>all the whole Law and Prophets do depend on Love</hi> or Charity; and the Apoſtle afterwards confirm'd, <hi>That Charity is the end of the commandment, and the fulfilling of the law;</hi> none can doubt, but that this, as a principal duty, ought with all diligence to be taken care of, That the faithful be excited to the ſincere love of the immenſe goodneſs of God towards us, and being inflam'd with a kind of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ardor, be wrapp'd up to the ſupream and moſt perfect good. To adhere to which, he ſufficiently feels it to be the moſt true and ſolid happineſs, who can ſay with the Prophet,<note place="margin">Pſal. 72.25. 1 Cor. 12.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>What have I in Heav'n but thee, and what on earth do I deſire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thee.</hi> This indeed is that <hi>more excellent way,</hi> which the Apoſtle has ſhewn, when he directs all the courſe of his doctrine and teaching to <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which never fails.</hi> For whether any thing be propos'd to be believ'd, to be hoped, to be done; the love of our Lord ought always ſo to be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended therein; that any one might perceiv all the works of perfect chriſtian vertue, to have their birth or original from love only; nor are they to be referr'd to any other end than to love only.</p>
            <p>But whereas in teaching any thing,<note place="margin">XIV.

               <hi>That he who teaches may become all things to all men:</hi>

               <hi>infants new born; others begin to grow to man-hood in Chriſt, and ſome do grow in a manner to full age:</hi> It is neceſſary to conſider, who they are <hi>that have need of milk;</hi> who, <hi>of more ſolid meat;</hi>

               <hi>till we all come into the unity of the faith, into the perfect man-hood of the knowledge of the Son of God, into the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs or age of Chriſt.</hi> The Apoſtle yielded himſelf an example to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by all herein, when he ſaid,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.14.</note> 
               <hi>That he was debtor both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians; both to the wiſe, and to the unwiſe:</hi> to wit, That thoſe that are call'd to the miniſtery might know, that they ought ſo to accommodate their doctrin to the capacity and reach of their hearers, in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the myſteries of faith and rules of life, that when they have fill'd the ſouls of them,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.14.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Nor ought it at all to diſcourage any ones en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors in teaching,<note place="margin">XVIII. The ſixth.</note> becauſe it is ſometimes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the hearers to be taught the rules of thoſe things which are common and deſpicable; altho frequently it is not without ſome difficulty that they are handl'd by thoſe, whoſe minds are taken up with, and take a kind of pleaſure in the contemplation of the more ſublime and lofty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For,<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 8.8.</note> if the wiſdom of the eternal Father came down to the earth in the meanneſs of our fleſh, to teach us the rules of the heav'nly life; who is there whom the love of Chriſt cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain to become little among his brethren, and as a nurſe foſtering her little infants; ſo earneſtly to deſire and endeavour the ſalvation of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 2.8.</note> 
               <hi>That,</hi> as the Apoſtle teſtifies of himſelf, <hi>he

            </p>
            <p>Now the Rule of all that doctrin which the faithful are to be taught,<note place="margin">XIX. Whence the Chriſtian doctrin is to be fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> is contain'd in the word of God, and is divided into Scripture and Tradition. The Paſtors therefore ſhou'd night and day be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating on theſe things. Always remembering S. <hi>Pauls</hi> admonition, which he wrote to <hi>Timothy,</hi> which alſo, all that have cure of ſouls ſhou'd reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as belonging to themſelves, and this is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,<note place="margin">1 Tim 4.13. 2 Tim. 3.16, 17.</note>

The Apoſtles Creed, The Sacraments, The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue</hi> or ten Commandments. <hi>And The Lords Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For all thoſe things which are to be held by the diſcipline of Chriſtian faith,<note place="margin">XXI.

            <p>It ſeem'd good therefore to admoniſh the pariſh Curates,<note place="margin">XXV. The manner of divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Catechiſm into ſeveral Sundays.</note> that as often as it came in their way to interpret any place of the Goſpel, or any other place of holy Scripture, they may know the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that place, whatſoever it be, falls under one of theſe heads we have even now mention'd; whither they may have recourſe, as to the fountain of all doctrin, for explanation of it. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, If the Goſpel of the firſt <hi>Sunday</hi> in <hi>Advent</hi> be to be explain'd:<note place="margin">Luc. 21 25.</note> 
               <hi>There ſhall be ſigns in the ſun and in the moon,</hi> &amp;c. What is pertinent to the explanation thereof, is handl'd under the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Creed <hi>[He ſhall come to judge the quick and the dead]</hi> which being thence taken, the Paſtor may with the ſame pains inſtruct the faithful people, both in the Creed and in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Wherefore in all the parts of teaching and interpreting, he will do well to hold to this practice of directing all things to thoſe four chief points, to which we thought fit to refer the whole power and doctrin of holy Scripture; but yet to take that order in teaching, as will be moſt proper both to the perſons to be taught, and to the ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>We following the authority of the Fathers,<note place="margin">XXVI.

               <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> For, whereas the end propoſed to man for his happineſs, is far higher than for him to attain to by any human underſtanding, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that he receive the knowledg thereof from God. Now this knowledg is nothing elſe but <hi>Faith,</hi> by vertue whereof it comes to paſs, that we aſſuredly hold that for truth, which the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of our moſt holy mother the Church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves as deliver'd by God For the faithful can by no means doubt of thoſe things, whereof God, who is the very truth it ſelf, is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. Whence we perceive how great a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is betwixt this <hi>Faith,</hi> which we have towards God, and that which we bear towards the writers of human ſtories.

               <p>I <hi>Believ in God</hi>] There are in Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion many things propos'd to the faithful,<note place="margin">I. What the Creed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</note> whereof there muſt be had, either ſeverally or univerſally, an aſſur'd and firm Faith. But then This firſt of all and neceſſarily all are bound to believe, which, as the very foundation of truth, God himſelf has taught us, to wit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Unity of the divine Eſſence and Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the three Perſons, and their actions, and for what ſpecial reaſon they are attributed to them. The Curate is to teach that the doctrin
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63052:19"/> of this myſtery is briefly comprehended in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Creed.</p>
               <p>For as our fore-fathers,<note place="margin">II. The diviſion of the Creed.</note> who were both piouſly and learnedly skill'd in this point, have obſerv'd; it ſeems to be divided into Three principal parts; ſo as in one. The Firſt perſon of the divine nature, and wonderful work of the creation is deſcrib'd. In the other, the Second perſon, and the myſtery of man's redemption. In the third part is concluded the doctrin of the Third perſon, the head and fountain of our holineſs, all in various and fit ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. Now, thoſe ſentences by a kind of ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude often us'd by our fore-fathers, we call Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. For as the members of our body are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht by joynts: So alſo in this confeſſion of Faith, whatſoever is to be believ'd by us ſeparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diſtinctly from another thing, we rightly and fitly call an Article.</p>

                     <hi>mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Heav'n and Earth.</hi>] The meaning of theſe words is this, I certainly <hi>believ,</hi> and without any doubting, do profeſs <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> to wit, the firſt perſon in the Trinity; who, by his <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi> power, created out of nothing, the very <hi>Heav'ns</hi> and the <hi>Earth</hi> and all things contain'd in them; and having created them, he defends and governs them all: Nor do I only in heart <hi>believ,</hi> or by my mouth profeſs, but with my utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, and ſtrongeſt affection I reach towards him as my ſupreme and moſt compleat good. This then is a ſhort account of the firſt Article. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in almoſt every one of theſe words, there lies hid mighty myſteries; the Curate ought to weigh them more diligently, that as far as God ſhall permit, the faithful may be brought with fear and trembling to the contemplation of the glory of his Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>[Believ]</hi> does not therefore in this place ſignifie,<note place="margin">II. What it is to believ.</note> to think, to ſuppoſe, to be of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but, as the holy Scriptures teach, it ſignifies a moſt firm and ſure aſſent, whereby the mind
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63052:19"/> does firmly and conſtantly adhere to God in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of his myſteries. Wherefore he does rightly believ (in the ſense here meant) who is fully and certainly perſwaded of a thing without any doubt or wavering.</p>
                  <p>Nor ought any one to think that the knowledg of Faith is leſs certain,<note place="margin">III. The aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of faith.</note> becauſe thoſe things which Faith offers to us to be believ'd, are not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beheld. For, the divine light, by which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we perceiv thoſe things, although it makes them not ſo very clear; yet it ſuffers us not to doubt of them. <hi>For God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.6. Ibid. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>he has ſhin'd in our hearts, that the Goſpel might not be hid to us, as it is to them that periſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now from what has bin already ſaid,<note place="margin">IV. Faith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity.</note> it follows, That he that has this heav'nly knowledg of Faith, is freed from all curious enquiry. For when God commanded us to <hi>Believ,</hi> he did not require of us to ſearch narrowly into his divine judgments, or to pry into the reaſon or cauſe of them, but commands us firmly and immutably to <hi>Believ.</hi> And this <hi>Belief</hi> makes the mind contented in the knowledg of his eternal truth. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſince the Apoſtle witneſſes, <hi>That God is true, but every man a lyar;</hi> and ſince none but an arrogant or impudent fellow will refuſe to give credit to a grave and wiſe perſon, when he affirms any thing for truth; but preſſes him further to prove what he ſaid by reaſon and witneſſes: What raſhneſs and folly muſt it needs be for one that hears the very word of God himſelf, to demand reaſons for the heav'nly doctrin of ſalvation? Faith therefore muſt be held free, not only from all doubtfulneſs, but even from the very deſire of more certain evidence or demonſtration.</p>
                  <p>The Curate is further to teach,<note place="margin">V. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of faith neceſſary.</note> That he who ſays <hi>[I Believ;]</hi> beſides that he declares the inward aſſent of his mind, which is an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior act of Faith, ought alſo openly to confeſs and declare that which he imbraces and holds inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his heart, by a free and open profeſſion of his Faith; and this with the greateſt cheerfulneſs
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63052:20"/> and alacrity. For the faithful ought to have the ſame Spirit which the Prophet had, when he ſaid,<note place="margin">Pſal 115.1.</note> 
                     <hi>I believ'd, and therefore did I ſpeak:</hi> And to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Apoſtles, who anſwer'd boldly, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the princes of the people, <hi>We cannot but ſpeak thoſe things which we have ſeen and heard:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 4.20.</note> and be mov'd with the excellent ſaying of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>

                     <hi>I am not aſham'd of the Goſpel, for it is the power of God to ſalvation to every one that believes.</hi> And again,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.11.</note> (that the truth of this ſentence might ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently be confirm'd) <hi>With the heart man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves to righteouſneſs, but with the mouth confeſſion is made to ſalvation.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>[In God]</hi> Hence they,<note place="margin">VI. How far faith excels the wiſdom of the world.</note> to whom it is given, may learn what the worth and excellency of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian wiſdom is, and thereby how much we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to the goodneſs of God, and may climb up, as by the ſteps or degrees of Faith, to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the moſt excellent and moſt deſirable thing in the world. For, herein does the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian philoſophy manifeſtly differ from the wiſdom of the world; That the wiſdom of the world guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the light of nature only, from the effects of theſe things which are perceiv'd by the ſenſes, making very ſlow progreſs, and that not without mighty toyl and difficulty, at length hardly reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to the contemplation of the inviſible things of God, and to acknowledg and perceiv the firſt cauſe and author of all things: But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Chriſtian philoſophy does ſo ſharp'n the edge, and illuminate the underſtanding of the mind of man, that without difficulty it can mount up to Heav'n; and being illuſtrated with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine brightneſs, can truly behold firſt of all, the very eternal fountain of light, and then thoſe things which are below him: So that with the greateſt ſweetneſs of mind, we can experimentally feel,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.9.</note> and with unutterable joy we can exult that <hi>we are called out of darkneſs into unſpeakable light,</hi> as the prince of the Apoſtles has it. Rightly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the firſt place do the faithful profeſs to <hi>believ in God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. 18. Jer. 22.19.</note> whoſe Majeſty we with the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> declare to be <hi>incomprehenſible:</hi> For, as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63052:20"/> the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>He dwells in light inacceſſible, which no man ever ſaw, and which no man is able to behold.</hi> For ſo he ſaid to <hi>Moſes, No man can ſee my face and live.</hi> For there is need for that mind that will ſoar up to God, than whom nothing is higher, to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abſtracted and withdrawn from ſenſe: And this by nature, in this life, we cannot attain to.</p>
                  <p>Now tho the caſe be really thus;<note place="margin">VII. How God manifeſts himſelf Act. 14.16.</note> yet as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>God has not left himſelf without a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of his goodneſs, giving rain from Heav'n, and fruitful ſeaſons, filling mens hearts with food and gladneſs;</hi> which was the reaſon why the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers did not think meanly of God, not attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by any means any thing corporeal, any thing groſs, or mingl'd to him; to whom alſo they aſcrib'd the perfect ſtrength and fulneſs of all good; ſo that from him, as from an eternal never-fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fountain of goodneſs and bounty, does flow all that good, that all created beings, and perfect natures do enjoy: Whom they call'd <hi>wiſe author of truth, loving, just, bountiful,</hi> and by other names, ſignifying the ſupream and moſt abſolute perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Whoſe infinite power and immenſe influence, they confeſs'd, fills every place, and extends it ſelf to all things. But this is far better and more clearly underſtood from the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; as in that place, where it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Joh. 4.24. Matt. 5.48. Heb. 4.13. Rom. 11.23. Rom. 3.4. Joh. 14.6. Pſ. 47.11. Pſ. 144.16.</note> 
                     <hi>God is a ſpirit;</hi> and, <hi>Be ye perfect, even as your heavenly Father is perfect:</hi> And, <hi>All things are naked and open before his eyes;</hi> and that, <hi>O the depth of the riches of the wiſdom and knowledge of God!</hi> And, <hi>God is true:</hi> And, <hi>I am the way, the truth and the life:</hi> And again, <hi>Thy right hand is full of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs:</hi> And, <hi>Thou openeſt thy hand and filleſt with thy bleſſing every living creature:</hi> Laſtly, <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall I go from thy preſence?</hi> And, <hi>If I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend up into Heaven, thou art there; if I go down into Hell, thou art there alſo; if I take wings in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dwell in the utmoſt parts of the ſea,</hi> &amp;c. And, <hi>Do not I fill Heaven and Earth,</hi> ſays the Lord? Theſe are great and excellent things, which even
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63052:21"/> the Philoſophers by ſearching into nature and the effects of things, have conſequently diſcover'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature of God, and agreeable to the authority of holy Scripture.</p>
                  <p>And tho even hence we may learn how neceſſary this doctrine which came down from Heav'n, is,<note place="margin">VIII. Faith is more eaſie and yet more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than knowledge.</note> if we obſerv, that Faith is very excellent, not only in this, That thoſe things which only wiſe men, and that by long ſtudy and much labor can attain to, do lye open and plain and become eaſie and familiar even to the unlearned, as was ſaid before; but that that knowledge of things, which is got by Faith is much more certain, and much more frees the mind from error than any humane knowledge can poſſibly do. But how much more excellent then is the knowledge of God himſelf to be thought, to the attaining whereof, not the contemplation of nature, but the light of Faith opens the way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to believers. But this is contein'd in the articles of Faith, which teach us the unity of the divine eſſence, and the diſtinction of the three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; as alſo that God is man's ultimate end, from whom we are to expect the poſſeſſion of heav'nly and everlaſting happineſs. For ſo S. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches us, <hi>That God is a rewarder of them that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſeek him.</hi> How great theſe things are, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are goods of this kind, to which mere humane wiſdom can reach, the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> before the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Iſa. 6.4.</note> ſhews in theſe words. <hi>From the very beginning they have never heard, nor has any one told them; neither without thee, ô God, has any eye ſeen, what things thou haſt prepar'd for them that wait for thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From what has bin already ſaid,<note place="margin">IX. There is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one God.</note> we muſt confeſs. That there is but one God, not more Gods. For ſeeing we aſcribe the ſupreme good and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God, it is not poſſible that what is moſt abſolute and ſupreme, can be in more than one. But if any thing be wanting to make a ſupremacy to any one, he is thereby plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd to be imperfect: Wherefore ſuch want is inconſiſtent with the nature of God. This is prov'd by many places of holy Scripture; for it is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63052:21"/> written: <hi>Hear ô Iſrael: The Lord our God is one God:</hi>

For, that it ſo calls Prophets and Judges <hi>Gods,</hi> this is not done after the ſame manner which the Gentiles us'd, which fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wickedly phanci'd that there were more Gods than one: But by a certain cuſtom or form of ſpeaking, it wou'd ſignifie ſome excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or office which by the Grace of God was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd upon them. Chriſtian Faith therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievs and confeſſes, That God in his nature, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and eſſence is but one: As, for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the truth it is declar'd in the Creed of the Council of <hi>Nice:</hi> But riſing yet higher, it ſo underſtands <hi>One,</hi> as it worſhips Unity in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity: Of which myſtery we are now to begin to ſpeak; for it follows in the Creed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[Father]</hi> But becauſe the word <hi>Father</hi> is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to God,<note place="margin">X. How the name Father is proper to God.</note> not for one reaſon only, it muſt therefore firſt be declar'd what is the moſt proper ſignification of this place. Some even of thoſe whoſe blindneſs Faith never illuminated, did yet think God to be an eternal ſubſtance from which all things had their beginning, and by whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence they are govern'd, and kept in their proper ſtate and order. By a ſimilitude therefore taken from humane affairs, they call'd him <hi>Father,</hi> as they do him, from whom is ſprung a Family, and by whoſe counſel and command it is rul'd: So for this it was, that they call'd God a <hi>Father,</hi> whom they acknowledg'd the Maker and Governour of all things. The ſame name alſo have the holy Scriptures uſed, when ſpeaking of God, they wou'd ſhew that the creation, power, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable providence over all is to be aſcrib'd to him.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63052:22"/> For thus we read,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Is not he thy</hi> Father <hi>who bears thee, who made and created thee?</hi> And elſewhere: <hi>Have we not all one</hi> Father? <hi>Has not one God creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But much more commonly,<note place="margin">XI. God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Chriſt in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Rom. 8.15. 1 Joh. 3.1. Rom. 8.17. Heb. 1.21.</note> and by a kind of peculiar name, eſpecially in the books of the new Teſtament, God is called the Father <hi>of Chriſtians, who have not receiv'd the ſpirit of bondage to fear, but the ſpirit of adoption, to be the ſons of God, by whom they cry Abba, Father. For ſuch love has the</hi> Father <hi>beſtow'd upon us, that we ſhou'd be call'd the ſons of God,</hi> and be ſo. <hi>But if we be ſons, then heirs, heirs indeed of God, and joynt-heirs with Chriſt, who is the firſt begotten among many brethren, and is not aſham'd to call us brethren.</hi> Whether there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you regard the common reaſon of creation and providence, or that ſpecial one of adoption, rightly do the faithful profeſs that they believ God to be a <hi>Father.</hi> But beſides thoſe notions we have already explain'd, the Curates ſhou'd teach, that at the hearing the name <hi>Father,</hi> the mind is to mount up to higher myſteries. For that which is hid and ſhut up in that inacceſſible light, where God dwells, and which humane reaſon and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding cou'd never attain to, nor ſo much as ſuſpect, That the divine oracles under this name <hi>Father</hi> begin to unfold to us.</p>
                  <p>For this name ſhews us,<note place="margin">XII. The name Father ſhews a plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of perſons.</note> That in the being of God, not one Perſon only, but a diſtinction of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons is to be believ'd. For there are three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in one God-head. The Perſon of the <hi>Father</hi> who is begotten of none. Of the Son, who was begotten of the <hi>Father</hi> before all worlds. Of the Holy Ghoſt, who from all eternity alſo proceeds from the Father and the Son. But the <hi>Father</hi> in this ſubſtance of the Godhead is the firſt Perſon, who together with his only begotten Son, and holy Spirit, is one God, and one Lord, not in the ſingularity of one perſon, but in the Trinity of one ſubſtance. But now theſe three Perſons are to be underſtood as diſtinct only in their proprieties; for it would be a great wickedneſs but to imagine that there is any thing unlike or unequal in them.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63052:22"/> For the <hi>Father</hi> is not begotten: The Son is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the <hi>Father:</hi> The holy Ghoſt proceeds from them both. And thus we confeſs that the three Perſons have the ſame being, and the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. So that in the confeſſion of the true and eternal Godhead, we do holily and religiouſly worſhip both a propriety in the Perſons, an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the eſſence, and equality in the Trinity.</p>
                  <p>For when we ſay that the Perſon of the <hi>Father</hi> is Firſt,<note place="margin">XIII. How the Firſt perſon is a <hi>Father.</hi>
                     </note> it it not ſo to be underſtood as if we thought any thing to be firſt or laſt, greater or leſs in the Trinity. Far be it from all the faithful to think ſo impiouſly, ſince Chriſtian Religion teaches, that the ſame Eternity, the ſame Majeſty and Glory is alike in all the three Perſons.

                  <p>Now by this Name of God we plainly perceiv,<note place="margin">XVI. What the word <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies</note> that there is nothing, nay that we cannot ſo much as conceiv any thing in our mind or thought which God cannot bring to paſs.

And yet, tho God <hi>can</hi> do all things, yet he cannot lye, deceiv, be deceiv'd, or ſin, or be ignorant at all, or periſh; for ſuch things belong only to a Nature or Being, whoſe actions are imperfect; but we ſay God cannot do theſe things, becauſe his actions are always moſt perfect; becauſe to be able to do theſe things, is a ſign of weakneſs, and not of that ſupreme and unlimited Power which God has. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo believ God to be <hi>Almighty,</hi> that we abhor to think or imagine any thing of him which is not moſt agreeable to the moſt perfect Being.</p>

For when we acknowledg God to be <hi>Almighty,</hi> we muſt needs confeſs that he knows all things, and that all things are ſubject to his Rule and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And when we doubt not in the leaſt of his <hi>Ability</hi> to do all things, it muſt needs follow that we muſt allow all thoſe other things, which if he ſhou'd not have, we cannot underſtand how he is <hi>Almighty.</hi> Beſides there is nothing ſo powerful to ſtrengthen our Faith and Hope, as to have this always ſettl'd in our mind, that there is nothing which God <hi>cannot</hi> do: For whatſoever we ought to believ, tho it be great, tho it be wonderful, tho it exceeds the Order and Meaſure of things; yet humane Reaſon eaſily and without any doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yields and aſſents to it, when once it owns that God is <hi>Almighty.</hi> Yea rather by how much the greater thoſe things are which the Oracles of God teach, by ſo much the more readily does it account
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63052:24"/> them to be believ'd. And if any great good thing be promis'd and expected, the mind is not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd altho the thing it deſires were too great.

For when once the Jewiſh Commonwealth and Religion became Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This began to grow more common, and known to his people. For there were many things which ſignifi'd, and many Men which foretold, What and how great good things that Saviour, and our Redeemer Jeſus Chriſt was to bring us. And indeed the Prophets, whoſe Minds were illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with Light from Heav'n foretold the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Birth of the Son of God,<note place="margin">Iſa. 7.15 8.3.9.6.11.1.53. throughout.

So that excepting the difference of time only, we cou'd not diſcover any diverſity between the Predictions of the Prophets, and the preaching of the Apoſtles; between the Faith of the old Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, and our own. But now we will ſpeak of the ſeveral parts of the Article.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ieſus</hi> is his proper name,<note place="margin">VII. What the name Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſignifies, and by whom it was given. Luc. 1.31.</note> who is God and Man, and it ſignifies a Saviour; and this name was given him, not by chance, nor by the judgment or will of Men, but by the counſel and command of God: For ſo the Angel told <hi>Mary</hi> his Mother: <hi>Behold, thou ſhalt cenceiv in thy Womb, and bring forth a Son, and ſhalt call his name Jeſus;</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he not only commanded <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of the Virgin, to call the Child by that name; but alſo tells the reaſon why he was to be ſo call'd: For he ſays, <hi>Joſeph thou Son of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 1.21.</note> 
                     <hi>fear not to take to thee Mary thy Wife, for that which is born in her, is of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> And likewiſe her Son, <hi>and thou ſhalt call his name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their Sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:63052:33"/>
                  <p>We read in Holy Scripture of many who were of this name: As the ſon of <hi>Nun,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">VIII The name Jeſus ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Chriſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.</note> who ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Moſes,</hi> and led the people, whom <hi>Moſes,</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> into the Land of Promiſe, which was deny'd to <hi>Moſes. Joſedech</hi> the ſon of a Prieſt was call'd by the ſame name. But how much more truly ought we to believ, That our Saviour ought to be call'd by this name, who has brought light, liberty, and ſalvation, not to one People or Nation only, but to all Men, of all ages; oppreſs'd, not with Famine, or with Egyptian or Babylonian Bondage, but ſittng in the ſhadow of Death, and miſerably fetterd in Sin, and the chains of the Devil, and has purchas'd for them a Right and Inheritance in the Kindom of Heav'n, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd them to God the Father. In them we ſee Chriſt our Lord ſhadow'd, who heaps upon mankind thoſe Bleſſings here mention'd. Now all thoſe names before ſpoken of, which by divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment were to be given to the Son of God, are all to be referr'd to this one name <hi>Jeſus.</hi> For whereas all the other, in ſome meaſure, had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touch'd the Salvation, he was to give us; this one conteins the whole weight and vertue of the compleat Salvation of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>And to the name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">IX. Why the name Chriſt added to the name Jeſus.</note> this name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is alſo added, which ſignifies <hi>Anointed,</hi> and is a name both of Honour and Office, nor is it proper to one thing, but common to more. For our old Fathers were us'd to call Prieſts and Kings, whom God had commanded to be anointed for the dignity of their Office, <hi>Chriſts.</hi> The Prieſts were they,<note place="margin">Reg 12 3.24.6.</note> who in their daily Prayers recommended the people to God, and offer'd Sacrifice to God for them. Kings had the government of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple committed to them, and to them chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs the power of the Laws, to protect the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and to correct the boldneſs of the Wicked. Becauſe therefore both of theſe Offices ſeem to relate to the Majeſty of God in the Earth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe that were choſen to the Office of King or Prieſt, were anointed with Oyl. It was cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary alſo to anoint the Prophets, who as the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63052:33"/> Interpreters and Ambaſſadors of the immortal God, open'd to us the Secrets of Heav'n, and by wholeſome Precepts, and foretelling things to come, warn'd Men to mend their manners.</p>
                  <p>But when <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Saviour came into the World,<note place="margin">X. Chriſt a Prophet, King, and Prieſt.</note> he undertook the Part and Office of all theſe three Perſons, <hi>Prophet, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> and for theſe cauſes he is call'd <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and anointed for the diſcharge of thoſe Offices, not by the act of any mortal, but by the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and vertue of his Heav'nly Father; not with earthly Oyntment, but with ſpiritual Oyl, when the fulneſs of the Holy Spirit, and Grace, and a more plentiful meaſure of all gifts was pour'd into his moſt Holy Soul, than the Being or Nature of any other Creature was able to receiv, and this the Prophet plainly ſhews, when ſpeaking to the Redeemer himſelf, he ſaid,<note place="margin">Pſ. 44.7.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou haſt lov'd Righteouſneſs, and hated Iniquity, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, even thy God has anointed thee with the Oyl of Gladneſs above thy Fellows.</hi> The ſame thing, but much more plainly has the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſhew'd in theſe Words:<note place="margin">Iſay. 61.1.</note> 
                     <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe the Lord has ſent me to preach to the meek.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> therefore was that great Prophet and <hi>Teacher,</hi>

                     <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for ever, after the Order of Melchiſedech:</hi> Which Argument, the Apoſtle writing to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> handles excellently. But we acknowledg <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be a King alſo, not only as he is <hi>God,</hi> but as he is <hi>Man,</hi> and partakes

To him therefore God deliver'd the government of the World, and to him he ſubjected all things. He has already begun his reign, but in the day of Judgment he ſhall enjoy it fully and perfectly.</p>

Verily there is nothing can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſhine more glorious and magnificent than the Bounty and goodneſs of God towards us.</p>
                  <p>The greatneſs of this Myſtery therefore,<note place="margin">II. The ſenſe of this Article.</note> which the Holy Scripture propoſes to us to conſider, as the chief point of our Salvation, the Curat may begin to ſhew in the explaining this <hi>Third Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,</hi> the meaning whereof he may teach to be this. That we believ and confeſs, that this very Jeſus Chriſt our ohly Lord,<note place="margin">Matt. 1.23. Joh. 1.36.</note> the Son of God, when for our ſakes he took upon himſelf Humane Fleſh in the Womb of the Virgin, was not, as other Men, conceiv'd of the Seed of Man, but beyond all order of Nature, <hi>was conceiv'd by the power of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſo that the ſame perſon remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, which he was from all Eternity, became <hi>Man,</hi> which before he was not.</p>
                  <p>That theſe Words are ſo to be underſtood, does plainly appear by confeſſion of the Holy Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> for thus it ſays; <q>Who for us Men, and for our Salvation, came down from Heav'n, and was Incarnate by the Holy Ghoſt of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> and was made man.</q> And this S. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt has alſo explain'd, as being he who drew the Knowledg of this moſt profound Myſtery out of the Boſome of our very Lord and Saviour himſelf. For when he had declar'd the Nature of the Divine Word in theſe Words. <hi>In the beginning was the Word,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 1.1.</note>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63052:36"/> concludes, <hi>and the Word was made Fleſh, and dwelt among us:</hi> For the Word, which was a Perſon of the Divine Nature, did ſo take upon him the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, that the Hypoſtaſis or Perſon, both of the Divine and Human Nature was but one and the ſame, whereby it came to paſs that ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable a Conjunction preſerv'd the Actions and Properties of both Natures, and as that great and holy Pope <hi>Leo</hi> has it,<note place="margin">Serm. 1. de Nat.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe the Explication of Words ought not to be omitted. It is requiſite that the Curat teach,<note place="margin">IV. What works of God are attributed to the whole Trinity.</note> That when we ſay, That the Son of God was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt, this one Perſon of the Divine Trinity did not make the Myſtery of the Incarnation. For tho the <hi>Son</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took the Humane Nature upon him: yet all the Perſons of the Holy Trinity, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, were Authors of this Myſtery; for we muſt hold this Rule in our Chriſtian Faith: That all thoſe things which God does <hi>(extrà ſe)</hi> without himſelf in the Creatures, are common to all the Three Perſons, nor does one act more than another, or one without another.</p>
                  <p>But that one One perſon proceeds from another;<note place="margin">V. And what to the ſeveral Perſons.</note> this cannot be common to all; for the <hi>Son</hi> is <hi>begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> of the <hi>Father</hi> alone; the <hi>Holy Ghoſt proceeds</hi> from the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son:</hi> But whatſoever <hi>(extra illas)</hi> without them, <hi>comes from,</hi> or is done by them, the whole three Perſons without any difference do it, and of this kind we are to believ the Incarnation of the Son of God to be.</p>
                  <p>Now tho theſe things are thus,<note place="margin">VI. Why Chriſt is ſaid to be conceiv'd by the Holy Ghoſt.</note> yet the Holy Scripture is us'd to attribute to any one of the Three Perſons, thoſe things which are common to all the Three Perſons; for example. It aſcribes, the <hi>Power</hi> of all things to the <hi>Father, Wiſdom</hi> to the <hi>Son, Love</hi> to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And becauſe the Myſtery of the Incarnation of God, does manifeſt the ſpecial and infinite Good Will of God toward us, for this Reaſon therefore

The Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſts Conception declar'd</note> That there are many things done beyond the Order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſome again by the Power of Nature.

But that which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes both the Order of Nature, and the reach of Human Underſtanding, is this; That as ſoon as the Bleſſed Virgin, conſenting to the Words of the Angel,<note place="margin">Luc. 1.38.</note> had ſaid, <hi>Behold the Hand-maid of the Lord, be it unto me according to thy Word;</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the moſt holy Body of Chrift was form'd, and a Reaſonable or Human Soul joyn'd with it, and ſo in that very moment of time, he became perfect <hi>God,</hi> and perfect <hi>Man.</hi> Now that this was the ſtrange and wonderful work of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> there is no one can doubt, ſince by the Order of Nature, no Body can be inform'd by, or receiv a Humane Soul, but at the limited term of time.</p>
                  <p>But this alſo is very wonderful,<note place="margin">VIII. Chriſt not Man, before God.</note> That ſo ſoon as ever the Soul of Chriſt was joyned with his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, his very God-head or Divinity was alſo knit together with his Soul and Body: Wherefore his Body was at once both form'd and quickn'd, and his Divinity joyn'd to his Soul and Body.</p>
                  <p>Whence it came to paſs,<note place="margin">IX. The Virgin truly Mother of God and Man.</note> That in the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of time, he became perfect God, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Man, and the moſt Holy Virgin truly and properly call'd <hi>Mother of God, and of Man,</hi> in the ſame moment wherein ſhe conceiv'd God and Man.

                     <hi>Behold thou ſhalt conceiv in thy Womb, and ſhalt bring forth a Son, and ſhalt call his name Jeſus; he ſhall be great, and ſhall be call'd the Son of the moſt High.</hi> By the event it was well prov'd what <hi>Iſaiah</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told,<note place="margin">Iſa. 7.14.</note> 
                     <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall conceiv and bring forth a Son.</hi> That <hi>Elizabeth</hi> alſo perceiv'd this to be the Conception of the Son of God, ſhe being fill'd with the Holy Ghoſt, declares in theſe Words.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63052:39"/> before their eyes, for their example to imitate, this ſo great and ſingular <hi>pattern of Humility.</hi> For what can be more uſeful or profitable to check the pride and haughtineſs of our hearts, than often to think, that God does ſo humble himſelf, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates his glory with men, and takes on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf their weakneſs and frailty; that God becomes Man, and gives that ſupreme and infinite Majeſty to Man, at whoſe Nod the very Pillars of Heav'n (as the Scripture ſays) tremble and quake for fear; and that he ſhou'd be born in earth, whom the very Angels adore in Heav'n. What there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſince God does theſe things for our ſake, what, I ſay, ought we to do in obedience to him? How willingly and chearfully ought we to love, embrace and perform all Offices of <hi>Humility?</hi> The Faithful ſee how <hi>wholſom a Doctrine</hi> the <hi>Birth of Chriſt</hi> teaches us, even before he began to utter his voice. He is born <hi>needy;</hi> he is born a <hi>Stranger</hi> in an <hi>Inn:</hi> He is born in a vile <hi>Manger:</hi> He is born in the depth of <hi>Winter;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luc. 2.6, 9.</note> for thus writes St. <hi>Luke, It came to paſs, that while they were there, the days were accompliſh'd that ſhe ſhould bring forth, and ſhe brought forth her firſt born Son, and wrapp'd him in ſwadling cloaths and laid him in a manger, becauſe there was no room for him in the Inn.</hi> Cou'd the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt include all the whole Glory, and Majeſty of Heav'n and Earth in more bumble expreſſions?

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe things when the Faithful remember,<note place="margin">XVII.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63052:39"/> Bleſſed Spirits cannot do; for as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>He in no caſe took upon him the nature of Angels, but he took upon him the ſeed of</hi> Abraham.</p>
                  <p>But then we ought to take heed,<note place="margin">XVIII.

For this it is, he being moſt earneſtly deſirous of our ſalvation, that he earneſtly calls for. For as by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, he was, beyond the Order of Nature, made <hi>Man,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 1.13.

                     <hi>That Chriſt the Lord was riſen again, having loos'd the Pains of Hell.</hi> Nor are all thoſe Receptacles of one and the ſame kind.

                  <p>And this we may eaſily perceiv,<note place="margin">VIII. Two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt's and the damned's going to Hell.</note> if we but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Cauſes, why Chriſt, and other Men came into thoſe places. For all others went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Captives, but he, as free among the Dead, and Conquerer to Maſter the Devils, by whom they were there kept ſhut up and impriſon'd by reaſon of ſin. Furthermore, All others who deſcended thither, partly were tormented with moſt bitter pains; and partly, tho they wanted all other ſenſe of ſorrow, yet being depriv'd of the ſight of God, and with-held in the Hope only of Bliſs and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which they waited for, they were in a kind of Torment. But Chriſt our Lord deſcended not to ſuffer any more, but to free the Saints and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Men from the Miſery and Trouble of that Impriſonment, and to beſtow upon them the Fruits of his Paſſion. That therefore he went down to Hell, was no leſſening of his ſupream Dignity and Power.</p>

                  <p>Theſe things being explain'd,<note place="margin">IX. Why Chriſt went down to Hell.</note> it muſt be taught, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord <hi>went down to Hell,</hi> that after he had ſpoil'd the Devils, he might lead thoſe Holy Fathers and other pious perſons, being now freed from Priſon, with him to Heav'n, which wonderfully and gloriouſly he has accompliſh'd. For immediatly the ſight of him, gave tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Light to the Captiv's, and fill'd their ſouls with immenſe joy and gladneſs: on whom he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo beſtow'd that moſt deſir'd Bliſs, which conſiſts in the Viſion of God: which done, it is manifeſt what it was he promis'd the Thief in theſe words:<note place="margin">Luc. 23.43.</note> 
                     <hi>This day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradice.</hi> But of this deliverance of the Godly, the Prophet <hi>Oſee</hi> ſo long before propheci'd in this manner, <hi>O death! I will be thy death; O Hell! I will be thy deſtruction.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> ſignifi'd the ſame thing, when he ſaid, <hi>Thou alſo by the blood of thy Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment haſt ſent them that are bound out of the lake wherein there is no water.</hi> Laſtly, the ſame thing the Apoſtle expreſſes in theſe words,<note place="margin">Col. 2.15.</note> 
                     <hi>in taking the ſpoils of principalities and powers, he made a ſhew of them, openly triumphing over them in himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that we may underſtand the force of this myſtery the better,<note place="margin">X. Who are ſav'd by the benefit of Chriſts Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> we ought often to call to remembrance, that devout men, not only who were born after the coming of our Lord, but thoſe who after <hi>Adam</hi> were before him, or who hereafter ſhall be to the end of the World, have, and ſhall attain Salvation by the benefit of his Paſſion. Wherefore before he dy'd and roſe again, the Gates of Heav'n were never open to any: but the Souls of the Godly when they departed this life were either carry'd into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſome, or as now it fares with them, who have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to be purg'd or ſatisfi'd, were cleans'd by the fire of Purgatory,</p>
                  <p>There is beſides,<note place="margin">XI. Another Reaſon of Chriſt's go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down to Hell. Phil. 2.10.</note> another Reaſon, why Chriſt our Lord went down to <hi>Hell,</hi> namely that he might there ſhew his Might and Power, as he had done in Heav'n and Earth, and <hi>that as every knee, both of things in Heav'n and things in Earth, bow'd at the name of him, ſo alſo of things below, and under
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63052:47"/> the Earth.</hi> At conſideration whereof, who is there, who admires not, and even ſtands not amaz'd at the immenſe bounty of God towards mankind, who was willing not only to undergo the moſt bitter Death for us, but alſo to go down to the very loweſt parts of the Earth, that he might carry with him the Souls ſo very dear to him, which he thence victoriouſly bore away to bliſs and happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Now follows the other part of the Article,<note place="margin">XII. The other Part of the Article con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2 Tim. 2.8.</note> in explaining whereof how painful the Curat ought to be, appears by thoſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt aroſe again from the dead:</hi> For what he commanded <hi>Timothy,</hi> it is not to be doubted, but that it is alſo commanded to all others that have the Cure of Souls.</p>
                  <p>And this is the meaning of the Article. After that Chriſt our Lord had giv'n up the Ghoſt on the Croſs upon <hi>Friday,</hi> at the ninth hour of the day, and the ſame day at Even he was bury'd by his Diſciples, who by leav of <hi>Pilate</hi> the Preſident, laid the body of our Lord, when they had tak'n it down from the Croſs, into a new Tomb, in a Garden near at hand: the third day after his death, which was the Lords day, early in the morning his ſoul was again join'd to his body, and ſo he who was dead thoſe three days, aroſe again and return'd to life, out of which he departed by death; but by the word <hi>Reſurrection</hi> we are not to underſtand only that Chriſt was rais'd from the dead, which was a thing common to many others, but that he roſe again <hi>by his own power</hi> and vertue, which was a ſingular thing, and proper to Him alone.</p>
                  <p>For it is contrary to Nature,<note place="margin">XIV. No man can naturally riſe again from the dead. 2 Cor. 13.4.</note> nor was it even granted to any man to be able by his own power to raiſ'e himſelf from death to life; but this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the ſupream power of God only, as we learn from thoſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Altho he was crucifi'd throw weakneſs, yet he liv's by the power of God:</hi> which ſeeing it was never ſeparated from Chriſt's Body in the Sepulchre, nor from his Soul when it went down into Hell, his Divine Power,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63052:47"/> was both in his Body, ſo that it cou'd be joyn'd again to his Soul; and in his Soul, ſo that it cou'd again be brought back to his Body; ſo that by his own power he might revive and riſe again from the dead.</p>
                  <p>And this thing,<note place="margin">XV. The Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told. Pſa. 97.2.</note> 
                     <hi>David,</hi> being full of the Spirit of God, foretold in theſe words, <hi>His right hand, and his Holy arm hath gott'n himſelf the victory.</hi> And the Lord himſelf by the divine teſtimony of his own mouth has confirm'd it, <hi>I lay down my life, and I will take it up again:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 10.17.</note> and <hi>I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it up again.</hi> And alſo to the Jews, for confirmation of his doctrin, he ſaid,<note place="margin">Joh. 2.19.</note> 
                     <hi>Diſſolve this temple, and in three days I will raiſe it up again.</hi> Which tho they indeed under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of that Temple magnificently built of Stones; yet he, as is declar'd in the ſame place by the words of Scripture,<note place="margin">Act. 1.24.</note> 
                     <hi>ſpake of the Temple of his Body.</hi> Now although we ſometimes read in Scripture, that Chriſt our Lord was raiſed by the <hi>Father,</hi> this is to be underſtood of Chriſt as <hi>Man;</hi> ev'n as thoſe things again relate to himſelf as <hi>God,</hi> whereby is ſignifi'd, that he roſe again <hi>by his own Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this alſo belongs ſpecially to Chriſt,<note place="margin">XVI. Chriſt firſt roſe from the dead. Apoc. 1.5. 1 Cor. 15.20.</note> that He was the <hi>Firſt</hi> who enjoy'd this divine benefit of the <hi>Reſurrection:</hi> For in Scripture he is called <hi>the Firſt begotten among the dead,</hi> and <hi>the Firſt begotten of the dead.</hi> And as the Apoſtle has it, <hi>Chriſt aroſe again from the dead, being the Firſt-fruits of them that ſleep: for verily by Man came death, and by Man came the Reſurrection of the dead, and as in Adam all dye; ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive, but every one in his own order, Chriſt the Firſt fruits, and afterwards thoſe that are Chriſt's.</hi> Which words are to be underſtood of the compleat Reſurrection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then we are rais'd to everlaſting life, all neceſſity of dying being wholly tak'n away. And in this kind Chriſt our Lord obtains the <hi>Firſt place:</hi> For if we ſpeak of ſuch a Reſurrection, or of ſuch a Return to life, as after which there remains a neceſſity of dying again;<note place="margin">3 Reg. 17.22.</note> there were many others <hi>ſo</hi> rais'd from the dead,<note place="margin">4 Reg. 4.34.</note> Chriſt: all which notwithſtanding reviv'd on this

                     <hi>Chriſt being now ris'n from the Dead, dyes no more: Death ſhall no more domineer over him.</hi> And now follows what is added to the Article.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The third Day.</hi>] The Curat muſt inſtruct the Faithful not to believ that our Lord was <hi>all</hi> thoſe three days in the Sepulchre:<note place="margin">XVII. Chriſt roſe again the third day.</note> For becauſe he lay in the Sepulchre a Whole Natural Day; and Part of the Day before it, and Part of the Day after it; for this Reaſon it is truly ſaid, That he lay in the Sepulchre <hi>Three days,</hi> and that the <hi>Third</hi> Day he aroſe again from the Dead.</p>
                  <p>Now that he might manifeſt his <hi>Divinity,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">XVIII. Why the third day.</note> he wou'd not put off his Reſurrection till the end of the World; and again, that we might believ him to be truly <hi>Man,</hi> and to be truly <hi>dead,</hi> he did not immediately after his death revive, but on the <hi>Third Day</hi> after his Death: Which ſpace of time ſeem'd to be ſufficient to prove he was truly dead.</p>
                  <p>The Fathers of the firſt Council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> have added to this place,<note place="margin">XIX. Why ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <hi>to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> is added in the Creed. 1 Cor. 15.14.</note> ACCORDING TO THE SCRIPTURES. Which being receiv'd from the Apoſtle, they therefore plac'd in the Creed: And that the Myſtery of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is very neceſſary, the ſame Apoſtle has taught us in theſe words: <hi>If Chriſt have not ris'n again, then is our preaching vain, and your Faith is vain:</hi> And, <hi>if Chriſt have not ris'n again, your Faith is vain, and you are yet in your ſins.</hi> Wherefore S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> admiring the Faith of this Article wrote thus:<note place="margin">De Auguſt. in Pſ. <hi>120. v. 4.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <q>It is no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to believ that Chriſt dyed, for this do the Heathens, Jews, and all the wicked believ, This all believ that he dy'd: But the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of Chriſt is the Faith of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> only: This we account a great matter to <hi>believ that he roſe again.</hi>

Three things to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd here.</note> we muſt know and obſerv three things, Firſt, Why it was needful that Chriſt ſhou'd riſe again: Then, What the Scope and End of his Reſurrection was, And alſo what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and Advantages redound to us thereby.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt,<note place="margin">XXI. Firſt. The neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Chriſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. Phil. 2.8, 9.</note> It was neceſſary for him to riſe again that the <hi>Juſtice of God might be manifeſt,</hi> by whom it was very meet that he ſhou'd be rais'd up, who in obedience to him, was caſt down and load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all kinds of Diſgrace. This Reaſon the Apoſtle brings, when he ſays to the <hi>Philippians; He humbl'd himſelf, and became obedient to Death, ev'n the death of the Croſs, wherefore God has alſo exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him.</hi> Beſides, <hi>for confirmation of our Faith,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which Man can attain to no Righteouſneſs: For this ought to be a main Argument, That Chriſt was the true Son of God, becauſe by his own Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he rais'd himſelf from the dead; and then <hi>to cheriſh and ſupport our Hope.</hi> For ſince Chriſt roſe again, we have a ſure Hope, that we alſo ſhall riſe again, for it is neceſſary, that the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers enjoy the ſame ſtate and condition with the Head: For ſo the Apoſtle ſeems to argue, when he writes both to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> the Prince of the Apoſtles ſays:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.12. 1 Theſ. 4.14. 1 Pet. 2.8.</note> 
                     <hi>Bleſs'd be God and the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who of his great mercy has begott'n us again to a lively Hope
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63052:49"/> throw the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the Dead to an Inheritance incorruptible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">XXII. The Second. The End of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</note> For this reaſon alſo it muſt be taught, That the Reſurrection of our Lord was neceſſary, <hi>That the Myſtery of our Salvation and Redemption might be compleated.</hi> For Chriſt, by his Death, has freed us from Sin; but by Riſing again he has reſtor'd us to all thoſe good things which we loſt by our ſins. Wherefore the Apoſtle ſays,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.15.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to Death for our Sins, and Roſe again for our Juſtification.</hi> That nothing therefore might be wanting to the Salvation and Happineſs of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as it behov'd him to Dy; ſo alſo it did to Riſe again.</p>
                  <p>Now from what has bin ſaid,<note place="margin">XXIII. The Third. The Advan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tages. The firſt</note> we may perceiv, How great advantage the Reſurrection of Chriſt our Lord brings to the Faithful.</p>
                  <p>For by his very Reſurrection, <hi>We acknowledg him to be God,</hi> Immortal, and full of Glory, and conqueror of the Devil, which without all doubt we are to believ and confeſs concerning Chriſt Jeſus</p>
                  <p>Beſides,<note place="margin">The Second.</note> The Reſurrection of Chriſt has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd <hi>the Reſurrection of our Bodies alſo:</hi> Becauſe it was the efficient cauſe of this Myſtery: And alſo becauſe, after the example of our Lord, we all ought to riſe again: For as to the Reſurrection of the Body, the Apoſtle thus teſtifies,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>By Man came Death, by Man came alſo the Reſurrection of the Dead.</hi> For there is uſe of Chriſt's Humanity, as of the efficient inſtrument, to all thoſe things, whatſoever they are, which God did in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of our Redemption. Wherefore, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection was a kind of Inſtrument to bring to paſs our Reſurrection. And it may be call'd a Pattern, becauſe the Reſurrection of Chriſt was of all, the moſt perfect: And as the Body of Chriſt, riſing to immortal Glory, was chang'd; ſo our Bodies alſo, which before were weak and mortal, ſhall be reſtor'd and adorn'd with Glory and Immortality. For as the Apoſtle teaches,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.20, 21.</note> 
                     <hi>We wait for the Savior, our Lord Jesus Chriſt, who ſhall change our vile Body, that it ſhall be like to his glorious Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:63052:49"/>
                  <p>And this may be ſaid concerning the Soul,<note place="margin">The Third.</note> dead in Sins; to which, on what ſcore, <hi>the Reſurrection of Chriſt is offer'd as an Example or Pattern to us,</hi> the ſame Apoſtle ſhews in theſe Words;<note place="margin">Rom. 6.4.</note> 
                     <hi>As Chriſt roſe again from the Dead, by the Glory of the Father; ſo ſhou'd we alſo walk in Newneſs of Life: For if we have bin planted together with him in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Death, we ſhall be alſo in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Reſurrection:</hi> And, a little after, he ſays; <hi>knowing that Chriſt being ris'n from the Dead, now dyes no more, Death ſhall no more domineer over him. For in that he dy'd to Sin, be dy'd once; but in that he lives, he lives to God: So reck'n ye your ſelves to be dead indeed to ſin, but alive to God in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two Examples therefore we ought to ſeek from Chriſt's Reſurrection. The one is,<note place="margin">XXIV. Two Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples from Chriſt's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</note> That after we have wip'd away the ſtains of ſin, <hi>we lead a new kind of Life,</hi> in which way clearly ſhine forth Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, Innocence, Holineſs, Modeſty, Juſtice, Beneficence and Humility. The other is, That we ſo <hi>perſevere</hi> in that kind of life, that by Gods help, <hi>we fall not off from the way of Righteouſneſs,</hi> whereinto we have once enter'd.</p>
                  <p>Nor do the Apoſtles Words ſhew only,<note place="margin">XXV. The Fourth Advantage of Chriſts Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Rom. 6.6,</note> That the Reſurrection of Chriſt is propos'd to us as an Example of our Reſurrection; but they declare, That it gives us Power to riſe again, and beſtows Strength and Courage, whereby we may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs. For as by his Death, we not only take Example of dying to ſin, but draw Vertue alſo, whereby we <hi>may</hi> dye to sin; So his Reſurrection brings us Strength to obtain Righteouſneſs, that thenceforth worſhipping God piouſly and holily, we may walk in Newneſs of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to which we are ris'n. For this eſpecially did our Lord bring to paſ's by his Reſurrection; that we, who before were dead with him to ſin, and to the world, might alſo with him riſe again to a new way and courſe of life.</p>
                  <p>The Signs of this Reſurrection,<note place="margin">XXVI. The ſigns of Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from ſin. Coloſſ. 3.1.</note> which are chiefly to be obſerv'd, the Apoſtle teaches us: For when he ſays: <hi>If ye be ris'n with Chriſt ſeek
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63052:50"/> thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſits at the right hand of God,</hi> he plainly ſhews, That thoſe who deſire to have Life, Honours, Reſt, and Riches there,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.8.</note> where Chriſt ſpecially is, are truly ris'n with Chriſt. But when he adds: <hi>Reliſh thoſe things which are above, not thoſe which are on the Earth;</hi> he has giv'n this as a kind of Note, whereby we may perceive whether we be ris'n with Chriſt. For as the Taſte or Reliſh is wont to diſcover the Temperature and Health of the Body; ſo if <hi>Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things are true, whatſoever things are comly, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are holy,</hi> do reliſh with a perſon, and if he can perceive with the inward ſenſe of his Soul, the ſweetneſs of heav'nly things, this is a good Argument, That he that is thus affected is ris'n with Jeſus Chriſt to a new and ſpiritual Life.</p>

                  <p>For, Firſt, he aſcended, for this Reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in this earthly and obſcure habitation, there could be no place ſuitable to his Body; which in

                  <p>Nor did he aſcend only to pſſeſs the Throne of his Glory and Kingdom which he merited with his Blood;<note place="margin">Second.</note> but alſo to take care of thoſe things which concern'd our Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Beſides,<note place="margin">Third.

                  <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">Fourth.</note> He has prepar'd a place for us,<note place="margin">Joh. 14.2.</note> which alſo he promis'd he wou'd do, and as our Head, in the name of us all, Jeſus Chriſt has tak'n poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the glory of Heav'n.</p>
                  <p>For at his going to Heav'n,<note place="margin">Fifth.</note> he open'd thoſe Gates which by <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin were barr'd up, and has clear'd us a Way, by which we may come to Celeſtial happineſs, as in his Supper he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told his Diſciples he wou'd do; which that the event of the matter might plainly prove it, he carri'd with him into the regions of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs, the ſouls of the pious which he had fetch'd out of Hell.</p>
                  <p>This bleſſed rank of Advantages follow'd upon that wonderful plenty of heav'nly gifts.</p>
                  <p>For firſt here is happen'd deſervedly a great advantage to our Faith:<note place="margin">X Other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of the Aſcenſion.

                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:63052:52"/>
                  <p>Moreover Chriſt's Aſcenſion into Heav'n has a mighty influence to confirm Hope in our Hearts,<note place="margin">Second.</note> for ſince we believe that Chriſt as Man went up into Heav'n, and has plac'd the Human Nature at the Right Hand of God the Father, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a ſtrong Hope, that there will be a time, when We alſo, that are his Members, ſhall aſcend thither, and be there joyn'd with our Head; which thing our Lord himſelf teſtifies in theſe words,<note place="margin">Joh. 17.29.</note> 
                     <hi>Father, I will that thoſe alſo whom thou haſt given me, ſhould be where I am.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then This alſo,<note place="margin">Third.</note> as a very great benefit, we have obtain'd, that he has drawn up our love to Heav'n, and inflam'd us with his Divine Spirit: For moſt true is that ſaying,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.21.</note> 
                     <hi>There our Heart is, where our Treaſure is.</hi> And indeed if Chriſt our Lord were dwelling on the Earth, all our thoughts wou'd be fix'd upon the face and acquaintance of the <hi>Man;</hi> and we ſhou'd behold him only as <hi>Man,</hi> who beſtow'd ſo great benefits upon us; and we ſhou'd affect him only with a kind of <hi>earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Good Will:</hi> But now being gone up into Heav'n; he has render'd our Love Spiritual, and makes us to love and reverence him as <hi>God,</hi> whom we now conſider as abſent.

                  </p>
                  <p>To this may be added,<note place="margin">Fourth.</note> that he has inlarg'd his Houſe,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.22.</note> 
                     <hi>i.e.</hi> his Church in the earth, which was to be govern'd by the power and guidance of the Holy Spirit: and he left <hi>Peter</hi> the Prince of Apoſtles, the chief Paſtor and Prelate of the whole Church among Men: and then he gave ſome

And This, thoſe words which are plac'd in the latter part of the Sentence, more fully declare, <hi>Which is prepar'd for the Devil and his Angels:</hi> For whereas ſo it is, that we can more eaſily endure <hi>all</hi> troubles if we have ſome Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Conſort of our Calamity, by whoſe pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and humanity, we may in ſome meaſure be reliev'd: what at laſt will be the Miſery of the Damn'd, who tho loaded with ſo great Torments, ſhall notwithſtanding never be deliver'd from the company of the moſt accurſed Devils?

                     <note place="margin">VI.

                  <p>And now what follows,<note place="margin">VII. How the Holy Ghoſt proceeds from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son.</note> 
                     <hi>Who proceeds from the Father and the Son,</hi> the Faithful are to be taught, That the Holy Ghoſt, by eternal proceſſion, <hi>proceeds</hi> from the Father and the Son, as from <hi>One Principle:</hi> For this the Rule of the Church, from which a Christian may not wander, propoſes to us to believe; and it is confirm'd by the authority of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63052:59"/> Scripture, and <hi>Councils:</hi> For Chriſt our Lord, ſpeaking of the Holy Ghoſt, ſaid:<note place="margin">Joh. 16.14</note> 
                     <hi>He ſhall glorifie me, becauſe he ſhall receive of mine.</hi> This ſame thing is gather'd hence, that in Holy Scripture the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is ſometimes call'd the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>Spirit of the Father:</hi> One while he is ſaid to be ſent by the <hi>Father,</hi> another while by the <hi>Son,</hi> that it may be plainly ſignify'd, that he does equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceed from the <hi>Father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.9.</note> and the <hi>Son. He that has not the Spirit of Chriſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 4.6.</note> ſays S. <hi>Paul, he is none of his.</hi> And the ſame he calls the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> when he ſays to the <hi>Galatians: God has ſent the Spirit of his Son into your Hearts, crying, Abba, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> In S. <hi>Matthew</hi> he is call'd the Spirit of the Father:<note place="margin">Mat. 10.20.</note> 
                     <hi>It is not ye that ſpeak, but the Spirit of your Father:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 15.25.</note> And our Lord at his Supper ſaid, the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclet</hi> or Comforter <hi>whom I will ſend to you, even the Spirit of Truth, which proceeds from the Father, he ſhall bear witneſs of me:</hi> And elſewhere, That the ſame Holy Ghoſt ſhou'd be ſent from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Joh. 14.21.</note> he affirms in theſe words: <hi>Whom the Father will ſend in my name.</hi> From whence, when we underſtand the <hi>Proceſſion</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, it is plain. That the ſame Holy Ghoſt proceeds from Both. And theſe are the things which muſt be taught concerning the Perſon of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>It is needful moreover to teach,<note place="margin">VIII. Of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of the Holy Ghoſt.</note> that there are certain wonderful <hi>Effects,</hi> and ſome bountiful <hi>Gifts</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which are ſaid to ſpring and flow front <hi>him,</hi> as from the everlaſting Fountain of Good. For tho the works of the moſt Holy Trinity, which are done <hi>extrinſically,</hi> are common to the <hi>Three</hi> Perſons; yet many of them are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd as proper to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> that we may know that they come to us of the immenſe Love of God: For ſeeing that the Holy Ghoſt proceeds from the Divine Will, as being inflam'd with Love, it may be perceiv'd, That thoſe <hi>Effects</hi> which are properly referr'd to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> do ſpring from the exceeding <hi>Love</hi> of God towards us.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore,<note place="margin">IX. Why the Holy Ghoſt is call'd a Gift.</note> hence it follows, That the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is call'd a <hi>Gift:</hi> For by the word <hi>Gift</hi> is ſignify'd that which is kindly and freely given,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63052:59"/> without any hope of Reward. And then whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good things or benefits are beſtow'd on us from God (for <hi>what have we,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſays,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.7.</note> 
                     <hi>which we have not receiv'd of God?</hi> thoſe things we ought with a pious and thankful Heart to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg were given us by the grant and gift of the Holy Ghoſt. But there are other effects of his: For to omit the Creation of the World, and the Propagation and Government of created things, of which we have made mention in the <hi>Firſt</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle; it was a little before ſhew'd, <hi>That the giving of Life</hi> is properly attributed to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and it is ſo confirm'd by the Teſtimony of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel:</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And yet the Prophet reckons up the principal <hi>Effects</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi>

Wherefore wiſely does S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> admoniſh us to obſerve, when in Holy Scripture there is mention made of this word <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> that we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern whether it ſignifies the <hi>Third Perſon</hi> of the Trinity, or his <hi>Effects</hi> and <hi>Operations:</hi> For theſe two are to he diſtinguiſh'd with the ſame dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, wherewith we believe alſo that the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator</hi> differs from the things he <hi>created.</hi> And theſe things are by ſo much the more diligently to be explain'd, becauſe from theſe <hi>Gifts</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> we draw <hi>Rules</hi> of Chriſtian Life, and may <hi>know</hi> whether the Holy Ghoſt be in us.</p>

                     </note> it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to reckon up the ſeveral <hi>Parts</hi> of the Church, and to teach the differences of them, whereby the people may the better underſtand the <hi>Nature, Properties, Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> ſo much belov'd of God, and for that cauſe never inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to praiſe the moſt holy Name of God.

                  <p>The <hi>Triumphant</hi> is that moſt glorious land hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py company of the bleſſed Spirits,<note place="margin">VIII. Which is Triumphant</note> and thoſe who have triumph'd over the World, the Fleſh and the Devil; and being deliver'd and ſafe from the Troubles of this life, enjoy eternal Bliſs.</p>

Nor is it yet to be thought that there are <hi>Two Churches,</hi> but that of the <hi>ſame</hi> Church, as was ſaid before, there are <hi>Two Parts,</hi> whereof the One is gone before, and has already obtain'd the Heavenly Country: The Other daily follows, till at laſt being joyn'd with our Saviour, ſhe ſhall reſt in everlaſting Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Now in the Church <hi>Militant</hi> there are two ſorts of Men, <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Bad;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">X. In the Church Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant are both Good and Bad Men. 2 Tim. 2.19. <hi>Concil. Trid. ſeſſ.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 12.

                  <p>And therefore it is not to be thought that Chriſt our Saviour ſpake of This Part of his Church, when he remitted us to his Church, and commanded us to obey Her: For ſince She is out of our knowledge, who can be aſſur'd, to whoſe Judgment we are to fly, and whoſe Authority we muſt obey? The Church therefore includes both the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Bad,</hi> as both the Holy Scripture, and the Writings of Holy Men Teſtifie: according to which Sentence is written that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.4.</note>

But tho Catholic Faith, truly and conſtantly affirms that both the Good and Bad do belong to the Church, yet from the ſame rules of Faith, the Faithful ought to be taught, that there is a far different reaſon and account of either part: For as the Chaff upon the Threſhing-flore is mingled with the Corn, or as ſometimes dead members remain joyn'd to the Body,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.4.</note> ſo alſo are Wicked Men contain'd in the Church.</p>

Yet it is not to be deny'd, but that they are in the power of the Church, as thoſe who may be judg'd by her, and condemn'd with an Anathema. Laſtly, The <hi>Excommunicate</hi> perſons alſo, in that by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, they are turn'd out of her, they belong not to her Communion till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.

For it is manifeſt that this is done by the infinite and immenſe Power of God, which we muſt needs believe to be the very ſame with that of raiſing up the Dead, and creating of the World.

                     </note> as is confirm'd by that ſaying of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> it be to be thought a harder work to make a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man Good, than to create Heaven and Earth out of nothing, ſince that creation cannot be but by an Infinite Power; it conſequently follows, That the Forgiveneſs of Sinners is much more to be attributed to an Infinite Power. Wherefore we own that thoſe ſayings of the ancient Fathers are moſt true, wherein they confeſs that Sins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd to Men by God only: Nor is ſo wonderful a work to be referr'd to any other Author,<note place="margin">Iſay. 43.</note> than to his ſupream Goodneſs and Power. <hi>I am He,</hi> ſays the Lord himſelf by the Prophet, <hi>I am he that blot out your Iniquities.</hi> For there ſeems to be the ſame Reaſon in the forgiving of Sins, as ought to be obſerv'd in a Debt of Mony. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mony which is owing cannot be forgiven by any but the Creditor, ſo when we are bound to God only by reaſon of Sin (for we dayly pray, <hi>Forgive us our Debts</hi>) it is manifeſt, our Debts can be forgiven us by no body but by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But this admirable and divine Gift,<note place="margin">VIII. Chriſt firſt of all had the Power of forgiving Sins. Matt. 9.6. Mar. 2.9.</note> before God was made Man, was never imparted to any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Nature. Chriſt our Savior firſt of all, as Man, tho he was true God alſo, received this Gift of his Heavenly Father. <hi>That ye may know that the Son of Man has power on Earth to forgive Sins,</hi> ſays he to the lame Man, <hi>Riſe, take up thy Couch, and go to thy own Home.</hi> When therefore he was made Man, that he might beſtow this For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of Sins upon Men, before he aſcended up
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:63052:69"/> into Heaven, there to ſit forever at the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand of God, he granted this Power to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Prieſts in the Church: Altho, as before we ſaid, Chriſt forgives ſins by his own Authority, but all the reſt only as his Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore if we ought to admire and receive thoſe things chiefly which are done by an Infinite Power;<note place="margin">IX. The Power of forgiving Sins the greateſt of Chriſt's Gifts. 1 Pet. 3.18.</note> we may wel enough perceive that this Gift which by the bounty of Chriſt our Lord is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to his Church, is the moſt precious. Yea, very Reaſon alſo will powerfully ſtir up the minds of the Faithful to contemplate the greatneſs of this benefit, whereby God, our moſt merciful Father has determin'd to blot out the Sins of the World: For he was willing to expiate our Wickedneſs by the Blood of his only begotten Son, ſo that he free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endur'd the Puniſhment, which for our ſins we had deſerv'd, and the Juſt was condemn'd for the Unjuſt, the Innocent was put to a moſt bitter death for the Guilty. Wherefore when we ſeriouſly conſider with our ſelves,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.18, 19.</note> 
                     <hi>That we were not redeem'd with corruptible things as Silver and Gold, but with the precious Blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without ſpot or blemiſh,</hi> we ſhall eaſily conclude that nothing could poſſibly come to us more advantagious than this power of forgiving ſins, which ſhews the unutterable of Providence of God, and his exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love towards us.</p>
                  <p>And from this conſideration it muſt needs be,<note place="margin">X. Mortal Sin how great an Evil.</note> that a mighty advantage redound to us. For he that offends God by any mortal Sin, whatſoever Merits he before had by the Death of Chriſt and his Croſs, he ſtraightway loſes all, and the Gate of <hi>Paradice,</hi> which before being ſhut, our Savior by his Paſſion has open'd to all, he has ſhut again againſt himſelf. Which when we remember, we cannot chuſe, but that the conſideration of Mans Miſery will extreamly grieve us, But if we bend our mind to this admirable Power which God has given to his Church; and being confirm'd in the Faith of this Article, believe that this Power is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to every one, ſo that being aſſiſted by Gods help, he may be reſtor'd to his former ſtate of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:63052:70"/> dignity; then are we forc'd with the higheſt joy and gladneſs to exult and give immortal Thanks to God. And truly, if thoſe Medicines are us'd to ſeem welcome and pleaſant which the skilful and careful Phyſitian prepares for us when we are ſick; how much more pleaſant ought thoſe remedies to be, which the Wiſdom of God has appointed for the cure of our Souls, and conſequently for the recovery of Life; and eſpecially when they carry with them not a weak doubtful Hope of Health, as thoſe Medicines do, which are apply'd to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; but when they bring moſt certain Health to thoſe who deſire to be heal'd.</p>
                  <p>The Faithful therefore are to be admoniſh'd,<note place="margin">XI. The Benefit of <hi>Remiſsion of Sin</hi> dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to be us'd.</note> after they have known the dignity of ſo ample and ſo excellent a Gift, that they ſtudy religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to convert it to their own advantage. For it can hardly be, that he who makes no uſe of a thing that is profitable and neceſſary, can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, not to deſpiſe it; and ſpecially ſeeing the Lord has deliver'd to his Church this Power of forgiving ſins, to this end, that all might uſe this wholſome remedy. For, as no one without Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm can be expiated or cleans'd; ſo whoſoever is minded to recover the Grace of Baptiſm which he loſt by mortal ſin, muſt neceſſarily betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to that other kind of expiation, to wit, the Sacrament of Penance.</p>

                     <hi>THe Reſurrection of the Body.</hi>] That this Article has a great influence to eſtabliſh the truth of our Faith;<note place="margin">I. How neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of this Article.</note> This does abundantly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that it is propos'd to the Belief of the Faithful, not only by the Holy Scriptures, but is confirm'd by many reaſons alſo. Which ſince we ſee it not done in the other Articles of the Creed, we may perceive that the Hope of our Salvation is grounded herein, as on a moſt foundation, as the Apoſtle argues,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.14.</note> 
                     <hi>If there be no Reſurrection of the dead, then is not Christ riſen again; but if Chrſt be not riſen again, then is Our Preaching vain, and your Faith is vain.</hi> In explaining hereof therfore the Curat ſhall take no leſs pains and care, than the wickedneſs of many has labour'd to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it. For that great and excellent advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges redound to the uſe of the Faithful by the knowledge hereof, will by and by be ſhew'd.</p>
                  <p>But firſt of all this is to be noted,<note place="margin">II. Why the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Men call'd the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Fleſh.</note> That in this Article the Reſurrection of Men is call'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Flesh. And this is not done without good reaſon: For the Apoſtles would teach what is neceſſarily to be ſuppos'd, That the Soul is, immortal. Wherefore leſt any one might think that the Soul dy's together with the Body, and that Both were to be reſtor'd to life again, ſeeing that by many places of Holy Scripture, it is plainly manifeſt that the Soul is immortal, for this reaſon, in this Article, there is mention made of the Reſurrection of the Fleſh only: And tho frequently in Holy Scripture the word <hi>Fleſh</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the whole man, as in <hi>Eſaias,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſay. 40.8.</note> 
                     <hi>All Fleſh is graſs;</hi> and in S. <hi>John, The word was made Fleſh:</hi> Yet in this place the word <hi>Fleſh</hi> ſignifies the Body; that we may underſtand that of the Two Parts, Soul and Body, of which Man is made, the One only, to wit, the Body is corrupted and returns into the Duſt of the Earth, out of which it was made; that the Sout remains uncorrupt.</p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:63052:71"/>
                  <p>But then whereas none can be reſtor'd to Life,<note place="margin">III. The Soul not ſaid to riſe again. 2 Tim. 2.14.</note> unleſs he had been firſt dead; the Soul is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſaid to riſe again. And there is mention made of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> to confute that Hereſie, which, during the Apoſtles life, was <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>'s, who taught, that when in Holy Scripture mention was made of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> it was not to be underſtood of a Reſurrection of the Body, but of the <hi>soul,</hi> whereby we riſe from the death of ſin, to an innocent life. From theſe words, therefore it is plain, that this error is taken away, and the true Reſurrection of the Body is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd.</p>
                  <p>But it is the Curates Part to illuſtrate and clear this Truth by Examples taken out of the Old and New Teſtaments,<note place="margin">IV. How the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Fleſh is to be prov'd.</note> and out of all other Church Hiſtories: For ſome were reſtor'd to life by <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha,</hi> in the Old Teſtament; others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe which Chriſt our Lord rais'd from death, by the Holy Apoſtles and many others:<note place="margin">3 Reg. 17.19 4 Reg. 4.34</note> which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of many, confirms the Doctrine of this Article. For as we believe that many were rais'd from death, ſo muſt we believe that all ſhall be call'd again to life. But that ſingular fruit which we ought to gather from Miracles of this kind,<note place="margin">Mat. 9.24.</note> is this, that we give the moſt certain belief to this Article. There are many teſtimonies which even thoſe Curates which are but indifferently skill'd in the Holy Scriptures, may eaſily meet with; but thoſe places which are more clear, in the Old Teſtament,<note place="margin">Job 19.25.</note> are thoſe we read in <hi>Job,</hi> when he ſays, that <hi>in his Fleſh he ſhall ſee God:</hi> and in <hi>Daniel,</hi> concerning thoſe who ſleep in the duſt of the earth,<note place="margin">Dan. 12.2.</note> 
                     <hi>That ſome of them ſhould awake to life everlaſting, and others to everlaſting diſgrace:</hi> And in the New Teſtament,<note place="margin">Mar. 22.31.</note> what S. <hi>Mathew</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of the diſpute our Saviour had with the Sadducees, beſides what the Evangeliſts tell us of the laſt Judgment: And hither is to be referr'd what the Apoſtle has exactly diſcours'd in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Theſſalonians.</hi>

                  <p>But tho to <hi>Faith</hi> this thing be moſt certain,<note place="margin">V.

                  <p>And firſt, ſince the Souls are immortal, and as a part of Man have a natural propenſity or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to the humane Bodies, it may be thought praeternatural that they ſhould for ever remain ſeparate from their Bodies.</p>

                     <hi>It is ſown,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>in Corruption, but it ſhall riſe in Incorruption.</hi> But the Schoolmen call this <hi>Impaſſbility</hi> rather than <hi>Incorruption,</hi> for this reaſon, to ſhew that it belongs properly to the Glorious Body: For <hi>Impaſſibility</hi> is not common to them with the Damn'd whoſe Bodies, tho they be incorruptible, yet they can burn, and freez, and be afflicted with divers Torments.</p>

Now this Brightneſs is a kind of ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glory redounding to the Body, from the moſt tranſcendent Happineſs of the Soul, ſo that it is a kind of Communication of that Bliſs which the Soul enjoys, after which manner alſo the Soul her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is made happy, becauſe on her, part of the divine Happineſs is deriv'd. But with This Gift, we are not to believe, That all are alike adorn'd as they are with the former. For all the Bodies of the Saints ſhall be indeed equally <hi>impaſſible,</hi> but the ſame <hi>Splendor</hi> they ſhall not have: For as the Apoſtle Teſtifies:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.41</note>

                     <hi>It is ſown an Animal Body, it is rais'd a Spiritual Body.</hi> Theſe are in a manner the chief heads, which are to be taught in the explaining of this Article.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, we muſt declare, That we muſt give the greateſt Thanks to God, who has hid theſe things from the Wife, and reveal'd them to little ones. For how many Men have there been exceedingly commendable for Prudence, or furniſh'd with ſingular Learning, who yet as to this moſt certain Truth have been ſtark blind? That therefore he has made known theſe things to us, who could not aſpire to that underſtanding, there is reaſon enough that with perpetual praiſes we celebrate his good-will and Mercy.</p>
                  <p>And then this great Fruit will follow from the Meditation of this Article,<note place="margin">The Second.</note> to wit, That in the Death of them who are joyn'd to us, either by kindred or friendſhip, we can eaſily comfort both our ſelves and others, which kind of comfort it's manifeſt the Apoſtle us'd when he wrote to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> concerning thoſe that ſlept.</p>
                  <p>And alſo in all other afflictions and calamities,<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 4 13.

                  <p>Beſides this will very much prevail with the Faithful,<note place="margin">The Fourth</note> to take great care to lead an upright and a juſt life, and wholly clean from all pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin: For if they but conſider thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great riches, which at the Reſurrection ſhall be given, and now are offer'd them, they will eaſily be drawn to the ſtudy of vertue and piety.</p>

When therefore <hi>Happineſs</hi> is there ſignifi'd in words, which ſuit no better with the Bleſs'd, than with all the reſt that live for ever; this is an argument to us, That there is ſome higher and more excellent thing which paſſes our Reaſon, to ſignifie it perfectly by any proper name.

But among the Latin Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,<note place="margin">And by the Fathers.</note> who have written Divinity, the word <hi>SACRAMENT</hi> is taken to ſignifie ſome Holy Thing which lies cloſe hid; as the Greeks, to ſignifie the ſame thing, us'd the word <hi>Myſtery.</hi> Now in the ſame ſenſe we underſtand the word <hi>Sacrament</hi> is to be taken, when it is thus written in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians, That be might make known to us the Sacrament of his will:</hi>

                  <p>Wherefore the Latin Doctors have thought that the Sacraments might conveniently be call'd certain <hi>Senſible Signs,</hi>

                        </gap> Reg. l. <hi>6.</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi> poſt i. it.</note> it is plain, that a Sacrament is of that kind of things which are us'd for <hi>ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation's</hi> ſake: For by a kind of Reſemblance and Likeneſs, it declares to us that thing which God by his Power works in our Souls, which Power cannot be perceiv'd by Senſe. For <hi>Baptiſm</hi> (that what is taught, may be better known by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) when we are outwardly waſh'd with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with the Uſe of Certain and Solemn words, ſignifies this to us. That by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt, all Pollution and Filthineſs of Sin is waſh'd away, and our Souls enrich'd and adorn'd with that excellent Heavenly Gift of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs And at the ſame time, that very Waſhing of the Body, as ſhall be ſaid in its proper place, works or cauſes that thing in the mind, which it ſignifies. But it is alſo clearly gather'd from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that a <hi>Sacrament</hi> is to be reckon'd among <hi>Signs.</hi> For the Apoſtle concerning <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> a Sacrament of the Old Law,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.10.</note> which was given to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 17.10.</note> the Father of the Faithful, in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> writes thus,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.11.</note> 
                     <hi>And he took the Sign of Circumciſion, a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith.</hi> And in another place, when he affirms, that <hi>we all, who are baptiz'd in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 6.3.</note> 
                     <hi>are baptiz'd in his Death.</hi> We may know, that Baptiſm has this ſignification, to wit, as the ſame Apoſtle ſays,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.4.</note> 
                     <hi>That we are bury'd with him by Baptiſm into Death.</hi> And this will be no ſmall profit to the Faithful, to underſtand that the Sacraments are <hi>Signs;</hi> for by this means it will come to paſs, that they will more eaſily believe thoſe things to be Sacred and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:63052:82"/> Holy, which are ſignifi'd and contain'd in, and wrought by them: And knowing the Holineſs of them, they will be the more mov'd to worſhip and reverence the Divine Bounty towards us.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>For ſome Signs are call'd <hi>Natural,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in our minds the knowledge of ſome other thing beſides it ſelf; (and this, as was before ſhew'd, is common to all Signs): as <hi>Smoak,</hi> whereby preſently is underſtood that there is <hi>Fire.</hi> And this <hi>Sign,</hi> for this Cauſe is call'd <hi>Natural;</hi> becauſe Smoak does not in the Will ſignifie Fire; but the Uſe of things cauſes, that when any one ſees <hi>Smoak</hi> only, he preſently in his mind and thought perceives that there is alſo the nature and vertue of <hi>Fire</hi> underneath, which as yet lies hid.</p>
                  <p>Now there are ſome Signs,<note place="margin">Appointed by Men. <hi>Aug. ibid. c.</hi> 3.</note> which are not by Nature made Signs, but <hi>invented</hi> and appointed by men for that purpoſe; as to talk with one another, and to tell freely to each other the ſenſe of their minds, and to be able to undeſtand each others Opinions and Counſels. But how vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and manifold theſe are, may be underſtood by this, that ſome of them belong to the <hi>Sight,</hi> others to the <hi>Hearing,</hi> and the reſt to the <hi>other Senſes.</hi> For when we <hi>Nod</hi> to any one, and, for example, ſignifie any thing <hi>by removing a Flag,</hi> it is plain that that <hi>ſignification</hi> belongs only to the <hi>Sight:</hi> As the <hi>Sound</hi> of Trumpets, Pipes and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ols, which is made not only for Delight, but ſometimes alſo for a <hi>Sign,</hi> belongs to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Hearing,</hi> by which Senſe eſpecially are words conceiv'd, which have the greateſt vertue to expreſs the inward thoughts of our mind.</p>

                  <p>Wherefore to ſhew more fully what a <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is,<note place="margin">X.

                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:63052:83"/>
                  <p>But then this alſo ſpecially belongs to theſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Signs,<note place="margin">XI. Every Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament ſignifies at leaſt three things, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Grace, the Paſſion of Chriſt, and Life Everlaſting.</note> which are <hi>inſtituted</hi> of God, that by Gods appointment they ſignifie not any <hi>one</hi> thing only, but <hi>more</hi> things together. Which thing may be ſeen in <hi>all</hi> the Sacraments, which ſhew not only our Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare two other things beſides, very nearly joyn'd with that <hi>Holineſs,</hi> to wit, <hi>Chriſt our Redeemer's Paſſion,</hi> which is the cauſe of our Holineſs: and <hi>Life Everlaſting,</hi> and the Bliſs of Heaven, to which our Holineſs ought to be referr'd as to the End. And this may be obſerv'd in all the Sacraments.

                     <hi>As many of us as have bin baptiz'd in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, have bin baptiz'd in his death;</hi> he plainly ſhews, that Baptiſm is therefore to be call'd a <hi>Sign,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it puts us in mind of the <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Paſſion of our Lord.</hi> And then when he ſays, <hi>We are bury'd together with him by Baptiſm into Death; that as Chriſt roſe again from the dead, by the glory of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo alſo ſhould we walk in newneſs of life:</hi> From theſe words it is plain, that Baptiſm is a <hi>Sign,</hi> whereby the Divine <hi>Grace is ſhew'd to be pour'd into us,</hi> by verture whereof, is given to us, that leading a new life, we can eaſily and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully perform all Offices of true Piety. Laſtly,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.5.</note> when he adds, <hi>For if we are planted together in the likeneſs of his Death, we ſhall be alſo of his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> it appears that Baptiſm, has no dark ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the <hi>Life Everlaſting</hi> alſo, which through it we ſhall obtain.</p>

                     <hi>Go ye and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> By that word <hi>[Baptizing,]</hi> the Catholic Church, which is taught of God, rightly underſtood, that in the <hi>Form</hi> of this Sacrament, the <hi>Action</hi> of the <hi>Miniſter</hi> is to be expreſs'd, which is done indeed, when it is ſaid, <hi>[I <hi>baptize thee</hi>].</hi> And becauſe, beſides the Miniſters, it is neceſſary to ſignifie both the <hi>perſon</hi> of him who is <hi>baptiz'd,</hi> and the principal <hi>Cauſe</hi> which makes <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> therefore the Pronoun <hi>[Thee]</hi> and the Diſtinct Names of the <hi>Divine Perſons</hi> are added, that ſo the abſolute <hi>Form</hi> of the Sacrament might be concluded in the words even now mention'd,<note place="margin">Joh. 1.33.</note> 
                     <hi>I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost.</hi> For it is not the perſon of the <hi>Son only,</hi> of whom S. <hi>John</hi> writes. <hi>This is he that baptizes.</hi> But all <hi>the Perſons</hi> of the Holy Trinity work together at the Sacrament of Baptiſm. But that it is ſaid in the <hi>Name,</hi> and not in the <hi>Names:</hi> This plainly ſhews, That there is but <hi>One Nature</hi> and Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the <hi>Trinity.</hi> For in this place the <hi>Name</hi> is not referr'd to the <hi>Perſons;</hi> but ſignifies that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Subſtance, Vertue,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> which is <hi>One</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> in <hi>all</hi> the Three Perſons. <hi>See Aug. cont.

The more Eſſential parts of the Form of Baptiſm.</note> which we have ſhew'd to be <hi>full</hi> and <hi>perfect;</hi> it is to be obſerv'd, that there are ſome things exceeding <hi>neceſſary,</hi> which if they ſhou'd be omitted, there can be <hi>no Sacrament:</hi> and there are <hi>other</hi> things <hi>not ſo</hi> neceſſary, but that if they ſhould be omitted, the Sacrament is made notwithſtanding, of which kind is the word <hi>[Ego, l.]</hi> the vertue whereof is contain'd in the word. <hi>[Baptizo, I Baptize:]</hi> Yea, and in the Greek Churches, changing the order of words,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:63052:93"/> 
                     <hi>they</hi> us'd to omit it, becauſe they thought it not fit to make any mention at all of the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi> Hence it is that they, us'd this Form in Baptiſm: <hi>[Let this Servant of Chriſt be baptiz'd in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt;]</hi> And yet it appears by the Sentence and Decree of the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> That this Sacrament was <hi>perfectly</hi> adminiſtred by them: Since by thoſe words is declar'd what belongs to the <hi>truth of Baptiſm:</hi> to wit, <hi>Waſhing</hi> or <hi>Cleanſing,</hi> which at that time is verily perform'd.</p>
                  <p>But if we may ſay that once there was a time,<note place="margin">XV. Why anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently the Apoſtles baptiz'd in Chriſt's name. Act. 2.38. Act. 8.20.</note> when the Apoſtles baptiz'd only in the name of <hi>the Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> We ought to be aſſur'd that they did this alſo by the inſpiration of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> that in the Infancy of the Church, their preaching in the Name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> might be the more remarkable; and that his <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>immenſe Power</hi> might be the more celebrat'd. And then, if we look more cloſely into the <hi>matter,</hi> we may eaſily perceive, that there was wanting in that <hi>Form,</hi> none of thoſe things which our Savior commanded to be obſerv'd. For he that but names <hi>[Jeſus Chriſt]</hi> ſignifies at the ſame time the Perſon of the <hi>Father</hi> alſo, by whoſe appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he was <hi>anointed;</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> who anointed him.</p>
                  <p>And yet it may ſeem doubtful. Whether or no the Apoſtles did at all baptize any in <hi>this kind</hi> of <hi>Form,</hi>

For that by <hi>any</hi> of theſe three ways Baptiſm was formerly rightly perform'd in the Church, and may be ſo again, does plainly enough appear from the Epiſtle of S. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, written to <hi>Leander.</hi> Yet the Faithful are to retain <hi>that Cuſtom</hi> or Rite, which they obſerve to be us'd in their <hi>own</hi> Church.</p>

                  <p>For whereas perfect Contrition is an Act of Love,<note place="margin">The Firſt Reaſon. 1 Joh. 3.</note> which proceeds from a filial Fear, it is plain that there ought to be the ſame meaſure both of Love and Contrition; hence it comes, That Contrition has joyn'd with it the moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement Grief of Mind; for as God is to be lov'd above all things; ſo thoſe things which eſtrange us from God are to be hated above all things.</p>

For after his Reſurrection, the Apoſtles being gather'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into one place, he breath'd upon them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:<note place="margin">Joh. 20.22.</note>

                  <p>When therefore the Lord gave power to the Prieſts of Retaining and Remitting ſins,<note place="margin">LIV.

                     <note place="margin">Joh. 11.</note> when he was rais'd from the Dead, from thoſe Bands wherewith he was bound. For S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> explains that place thus:<note place="margin">Aug. de vera &amp; falſa poenit. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Since therefore the Lord has given to the Prieſts a Power of Remitting and Retaining ſins, it is
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:63052:147"/> evident that they are appointed Judges of that Matter, and becauſe, as the Holy Synod of <hi>Trent</hi> has wiſely admoniſh'd,<note place="margin">Seſſ. <hi>14.</hi> c. <hi>5.</hi> &amp; can. <hi>7.</hi> de Poenit.</note> that a true judgment can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made concerning any thing, and in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing puniſhments of ſins, there can be no Meaſure of Juſtice held, unleſs the Cauſe be truly known and ſearched into; from hence it follows, that by the Confeſſion of Penitents, all ſins are ſeverally to be laid open to the Prieſts. <hi>That the Prieſts are Judges of ſins, S.

                  <p>The Paſtors therefore ſhall teach theſe things which have bin decreed by the Holy Synod of <hi>Trent,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">LV. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of what was ſaid before.</note> and always deliver'd by the Catholic Church. For if we attentively read the moſt Holy Fathers, we ſhall every where meet with moſt plain teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, whereby it will be confirm'd that this Sacrament, and the Law of Sacramental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, which they call'd in Greek <hi>Exomologeſis</hi> and <hi>Exagoreuſis,</hi> as receiv'd from the very Goſpel, was inſtituted by Chriſt our Lord. But if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire Figures of the Old Teſtament alſo, without doubt thoſe various kinds of Sacrifices, which were made by the Prieſts for the expiating of divers kinds of ſins, do ſeem to belong to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſins.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe the Faithful are to be taught that Confeſſion was inſtituted by our Lord and Savior:<note place="margin">LVI. Ceremonies us'd at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> It is fit that there ſhould be alſo ſome Rites and ſolemn Ceremonies added by the Authority of the Church, to admoniſh them, which tho they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to the vertue of the Sacrament; yet they put more plainly before mens Eyes, the dignity thereof, and diſpoſe the Souls of them that Confeſs, being already kindl'd with devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the more eaſily to obtain the Grace of God. For when with uncover'd Head caſt down at the Prieſts feet, with countenance down towards the Earth, and hands ſtretch'd forth in a beſeeching poſture, and giving other ſuch like ſigns of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:63052:148"/> Humility, which are not indeed neceſſary to the Reaſon or Vertue of the Sacrament, we confeſs our ſins; from theſe things we may evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently underſtand, both that there is a Heavenly Vertue in the Sacrament, and alſo that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mercy is to be ſought and procur'd by us with the greateſt ſtudy.</p>
                  <p>And now let no one think that Confeſſion was indeed inſtituted of the Lord,<note place="margin">LVII. The Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> but yet ſo, as tho he had not told us that the Uſe of it is neceſſary. For let the Faithful be aſſur'd of this, that he who is oppreſt by any Mortal Sin, ought to be call'd back to Spiritual Life by the Sacrament of Confeſſion. Which thing indeed by a very fair Tradition from our Lord we ſee plainly ſignifi'd, when he call'd, the <hi>Power of adminiſtring this Sacrament,</hi> the <hi>Key of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> For as no one can go in to any place,<note place="margin">Mat. 16.19.</note> without the help of him, to whom are committed the Keys: ſo we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that no one is admitted into Heaven ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Doors are open'd them by the Prieſts, to whoſe Truſt the Lord has committed the Keys.

Now this was excellently obſerv'd, by S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> when he ſaid;<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>50.</hi> hom. <hi>49.</hi>

                  <p>But ſeeing it cannot be doubted,<note place="margin">LVIII.

                     </note> whoſe, beginning is <hi>Omnis <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>triuſque ſexûs,</hi> it is evident that no body is bound by the Law of Confeſſion, before that Age wherein he may have the Uſe of Reaſon: Nor yet is that Age by any certain number of years defin'd. But this ſeems to be held in general, that Confeſſion ought to be enjoyn'd to a Child, from the time when he has the power of diſcerning betwixt Good and Evil, and when his mind is capable of ſorrow. For when any one comes to that time of his Life, when he can conſider of his eternal Salvation, then ought he to begin to confeſs his ſins to a Prieſt, when otherwiſe no one can hope for Salvation, who is loaded with the Conſcience of wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p>But at what time eſpecially Confeſſion ought to be made,<note place="margin">LIX. At what time Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion muſt be made.</note> Holy Church has decreed in that Canon before mentioned: For it commands all the Faithful to confeſs their ſins at leaſt once a year. But if we conſider what the Reaſon of our Salvation requires, verily as often as the danger of Death hangs over us, or that we ſet about any thing, the doing whereof does not ſuit with a perſon polluted with ſin; as when we admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or receive the Sacraments, ſo often Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not to be pretermitted. And the ſame thing we ought ſtrictly to obſerve, when we fear, or are likely to forget any ſin we have done. Neither can we confeſs ſins which we remember not. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we get Pardon of God for thoſe ſins, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Sacrament of Penance by Confeſſion blot them out.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe in Confeſſion,<note place="margin">LX.

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:63052:149"/> weightieſt Matters; and all our ſtudy ought ſo to be imploy'd herein, that we may cure the Wounds of our Souls, and deſtroy the very Roots of Sin. Nor ought we only by a Declaration of them to explain our grievous ſins, but alſo all the ſeveral Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of every ſin which either greatly increaſe or leſſen the ſins.</p>
                  <p>For ſome Circumſtances are ſo weighty,<note place="margin">LXIII. The Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the ſin muſt be confeſs'd.</note> that the Nature of the Deadlineſs of the ſin conſiſts only in them: wherefore all theſe things muſt always be confeſs'd. For if any one ſhall have kill'd a Man, it muſt be explain'd whether he were a Clerk or a Lay man. As alſo it is neceſſary that he declare if he lay with a Woman, whether ſhe were free from the Law of Marriage, or were another Man's Wife, or of his Kindred, or Conſecrated to God, by the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troathing of any Vow. For theſe things make the kinds of ſins different. So that the firſt by the Doctors of Holy things is call'd ſimple Fornication; The Second, Adultery; The Third, Inceſt; The Fourth, Sacriledge. Alſo Theft is to be reckon'd among ſins: But if any one ſhall ſteal a piece of Gold, he certainly ſins leſs than he that ſteals away a hundred or two hundred pieces, or a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Gold, and of eſpecially who ſtole the Sacred Mony. And this Reaſon belongs alſo to Place and Time, Examples whereof are more known in the Books of many, than that we ſhould make mention of them in this place.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>But to Confeſſion it is ſo neceſſary,<note place="margin">LXIV. To conceal ſin in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, a great Crime, &amp; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to be iterated.</note> as we ſaid before, that it be intire and abſolute, that if any one in Confeſſion paſs over ſome of thoſe things which ought to have bin explain'd, and confeſs'd only ſome of them; he not only by that Confeſſion reaps no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, but alſo fetters himſelf in a new wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Nor is ſuch a kind of reckoning up of ſin, to be call'd by the name of Confeſſion, in which is the Vertue of a Sacrament; but rather it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Penitent to repeat again his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and to acknowledge himſelf guilty of that
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:63052:150"/> ſin, that he violated the Holineſs of that Sacrament, by a counterfeit Confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>But if for any other cauſe there may ſeem to be any defect in the Confeſſion;<note place="margin">LXV. Confeſſion not to be iterated by reaſon of ſin forgot.</note> either becauſe the Penitent has forgot ſome ſins; or becauſe he has not ſo narrowly ſearch'd into the secret corners of his Conſcience; yet becauſe he had it in his mind, intirely to confeſs all his ſins, he has no need to iterate his Confeſſion: But it will be ſufficient, if, when he remembers the ſins before forgot, he confeſs them to a Prieſt at another time.</p>
                  <p>Wherein care muſt be taken,<note place="margin">LXVI. Negligence in examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt be avoided.</note> that we do not haply ſearch our Conſciences too diſſolutely and remiſsly, and ſo negligently ſtudy to bring our ſins to remembrance, that we may deſervedly ſeem to be willing indeed not to remember them: For if we do ſo, we muſt by all means iterate our Confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Moreover we muſt take heed,<note place="margin">LXVII. Confeſſion muſt be naked, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and plain.</note> that our Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be Naked, Simple, and Plain, not artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally compos'd, as is done by ſome, who ſeem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to lay down the Rule of their Life, than to confeſs their ſins. For ſuch ought to be our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, as it may ſhew us to the Prieſt to be ſuch Perſons as we know our ſelves to be, and may ſhew things certain for certain, and doubtful for doubtful.</p>
                  <p>But if ſins are not diſclos'd or recited, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>They alſo are much to be commended who uſe Prudence and Modeſty in explaining things,<note place="margin">LXVIII. Prudent and Modeſt.</note> for neither ought there too many words to he us'd; but thoſe things which belong to the Nature and Reaſon of every ſin are to be open'd in a ſhort Speech which is joyn'd with Modeſty.</p>
                  <p>But this muſt be endeavour'd both by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Perſon,<note place="margin">LXIX. Secret.</note> and by the Prieſt, that their ſpeech in Confeſſion be ſecret.</p>
                  <p>For which cauſe it is not lawful for any by any means, <label type="milestone">

                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:63052:150"/>
                  <p>But nothing ſo much requires the Care of the Faithful,<note place="margin">LXX. Frequent.</note> as to ſtudy to cleanſe their Soul by a frequent Confeſſion of their Sins. For when any one is tempted with any deadly ſin, there can be to him nothing more wholeſome or ſaving, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the many dangers which hang over our life, than preſently to confeſs his ſins. For it is a foul thing for any one to promiſe himſelf a long time to live, when we are ſo diligent in cleanſing the ſpots of our Body, or of our Cloaths, and not to uſe at leaſt the ſame diligence, that the ſplendor of our Soul grow not ruſty with the moſt filthy ſtains of ſin.</p>
                  <p>And now we muſt ſpeak concerning the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of this Sacrament. And that he is a Prieſt,<note place="margin">LXXI. An ordinary Prieſt the lawful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Confeſſion.</note> who has the Ordinary or Delegated Power of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving, ſufficiently appears from the Eccleſiaſtical Laws. For he muſt have, not only the Power of Order, but of Juriſdiction alſo, that diſcharges this Office: A clear teſtimony of this Miniſtery we have from our Lords words in S. <hi>John:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 20.23.</note> 
                     <hi>Whoſe ſins ye remit, they are remitted; and whoſe ſins ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, they are retain'd.</hi> And it is manifeſt that this was ſpoken not to all, but to the Apoſtles only, to whom the Prieſts ſucceeded in this Office: And this is very conſentaneous; for whereas eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind of Grace which is given in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is deriv'd to the Members from Chriſt the Head; rightly ought they to adminiſter this to Chriſt's myſtic Body, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the Faithful, who only have power of conſecrating his true Body; eſpecially ſeeing the Faithful by this Sacrament of Penance, are made fit and well diſpos'd for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacred Euchariſt.</p>

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:63052:151"/> they reveal in Confeſſion, ſhall ever be made known to any one by the Prieſt, or leſt he may at any time fall into danger thereby. For the Sacred Laws will moſt ſeverely revenge it upon thoſe Prieſts, who ſhall not have conceal'd, with perpetual and religious ſilence, all ſins which any one ſhall have confeſs'd to them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the great Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> we read thus:<note place="margin">Cap. 21.</note> 
                     <q>Let the Prieſt take ſpecial heed, that neither by Word, or Sign, or by any other way, he at any time betray the ſinner.</q>

For a great part of the Faithful, to whom commonly nothing ſeems more tedious, than the paſſing away of thoſe days, which by Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law are appointed for confeſſion, are ſo far from Chriſtian Perfection; that ſcarcely do they remember thoſe ſins which are to be reveal'd to the Prieſt, nor yet do they diligently take care of thoſe things, which it is plain have a very great Power to reconcile the Divine Grace to them.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore ſince all endeavor muſt be us'd to further their Salvation. The Prieſt ſhall careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve in the Penitent,<note place="margin">LXXVI.

                  <p>And if they ſhall obſerve him to be ſo affected,<note place="margin">LXXVII. When the Penitent is found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite, what he is to be exhorted to</note> they ſhall earneſtly admoniſh and exhort him, that for ſo great and ſingular a benefit, he give God his greateſt thanks, and never ceaſe to ſeek of him the protection of his Heavenly Grace: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with being arm'd and ſecur'd, he may eaſily reſiſt and oppoſe his evil luſts. He is alſo to be taught, that he ſuffer no day to paſs without me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating ſomewhat of the Myſteries of the Paſſion of our Lord, and ſtir up and inflame himſelf to imitate him, and to love him with the greateſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; for by this Meditation he will obtain this, that he will feel himſelf every day more and more ſafe from all the Temptations of the Devil.</p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:63052:152"/>
                  <p>For neither is there any other cauſe why we yield both our courage and our ſtrength ſo ſoon, and ſo eaſily to be overcome by the Enemy, than that we labor not by the Meditation of heavenly things, to conceive the Fire of divine Love, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our Mind might be refreſh'd and ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>But if the Prieſt ſhall underſtand,<note place="margin">LXXVIII. If he ſeem not to be contrite, what is then to be done.</note> that he that is willing to confeſs, does not ſo bewail his ſins, as that he may truly be ſaid to be contrite, he ſhall endeavor to affect him with an earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Contrition, that thenceforth being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd with the deſire of this excellent Gift, he may reſolve with himſelf to beg, and beſeech it of the mercy of God.</p>
                  <p>But firſt of all,<note place="margin">LXXIX. What is to be done with one who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes or leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens his ſins.</note> the Pride of ſome is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, who endeavor either to defend their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſes by ſome excuſe, or to leſſen them. For, for example, when any one confeſſes, that he was ſomewhat overmuch mov'd with Anger, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently charges another with the cauſe of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance, who as he complains, firſt did him the Wrong. He is therefore to be admoniſh'd, That this is the ſign of an exalted or proud mind, and of a Man that either deſpiſes, or elſe is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the greatneſs of his ſin. And alſo that ſuch kind of Excuſe does rather increaſe than leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the ſin. For he that ſtrives thus to approve his Fact, ſeems to profeſs, that he then will uſe Patience, when no body hurts nor wrongs him, than which nothing can be more unbecoming a Chriſtian. For whereas he ought very much to bewail the condition of him who did the Injury; yet is not mov'd with the naughtineſs of the ſin, but is angry at his Brother: And when a fair occaſion was offer'd him, to honor God with his Patience, and amend his Brother with his Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he turns the matter of his Salvation, to his Hurt.</p>
                  <p>But more pernicious is the Fault of thoſe to be thought,<note place="margin">LXXX. What to be done with thoſe who are aſham'd to confeſs.</note> who being hinder'd by a fooliſh kind of Baſhfulneſs, dare not confeſs their ſins. They muſt by Exhortation be encourag'd therefore,

                  <p>There are others,<note place="margin">LXXXI. What with the ſlothful, and thoſe that neglect Conſcience.</note> who, either becauſe they are us'd very ſeldom to confeſs their ſins, or becauſe they take no care and thought to find out their ſins, and know not well how to begin that Office, and having begun Confeſſion, know not how to diſpatch it; There is need certainly that ſuch as theſe, be more ſharply chid, and to teach firſt of all, that before any one go to a Prieſt, there muſt be great care and diligence us'd, that he be mov'd with contrition of his ſins; but This can by no means be done, unleſs he ſtudy to recollect and remember them ſeverally.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore if the Prieſt find ſuch Men as theſe,<note place="margin">LXXXII.

                     <note place="margin">LXXXIV. Of Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note>And now we come to the Third Part of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which is call'd Satisfaction. First therefore the Name and Vertue of Satisfaction is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. For, from hence the Enemies of the Catholic Church have taken a large occaſion of Difference and Diſcord, to the exceeding great Damage of Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>Now Satisfaction is a full Payment of a thing that is due,<note place="margin">LXXXV. What ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is.</note> for nothing ſeems to be wanting to that which is ſatisfactory or enough. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we ſpeak of Reconciliation to Grace; To ſatisfie ſignifies the ſame thing, as to give ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo much as may be ſuffictent to an angry mind to recompenſe the injury: And ſo Satisfaction is nothing elſe than a Recompence for an Injury done to another. But as to this place, the Doctors of Divinity have us'd the word Satisfaction to ſignifie that Recompence, when a Man pays ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to God for the ſins he has committed.</p>
                  <p>In which kind,<note place="margin">LXXXVI. The vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous degrees of Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> becauſe there may be many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, hence it is that Satisfaction is taken dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently.</p>
                  <p>And the Firſt and moſt excellent is that whereby,<note place="margin">The Firſt is Chriſt's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</note> according to the nature of our ſins, is paid abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to God, whatſoever is owing to him from us, altho he would deal with us according to the utmoſt Juſtice. Now this is ſaid to be of that kind, which renders God appeas'd and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:63052:153"/> to us. And This we have receiv'd from Chriſt our Lord only, who upon the Croſs having paid the price for our ſins, moſt fully ſatisfi'd God: Nor could there be any created thing of ſo great worth, as to free us from ſo grievous a debt; and as S. <hi>John</hi> teſtifies;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.2.</note> 
                     <hi>He is the Propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours only, but alſo for the ſins of the whole World.</hi> This Satisfaction therefore is full and compleat, equally anſwering to the Nature of all the ſins which are committed in the World, by the vertue whereof, the Actions of Men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail very much with God, and without him they would be accounted worthy of no regard. And hither the Words of <hi>David</hi> ſeem to have reſpect; who conſidering with himſelf, after that he had ſaid thus,<note place="margin">Pſ. 11.52.</note> 
                     <hi>What ſhall I give to the Lord for all the things which he has given me?</hi> He could find nothing but this Satisfaction, which he expreſs'd by the name of a Chalice, worthy ſo many and ſo great Benefits: Wherefore he ſubjoyns: <hi>I will take the Chalice of Salvation, and will call upon the Name of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another kind of Satisfaction is call'd Canonical,<note place="margin">LXXXVII. The Second is Canonical ſatisfaction.</note> which being defin'd is perfected in a certain ſpace of Time. Wherefore it has bin receiv'd by the moſt antient uſage of the Church, That when Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents are abſolv'd from ſins, ſome Puniſhment is requir'd of them, the undergoing of which Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is us'd to be call'd Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>By the ſame Name alſo is any kind of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſignifi'd,<note place="margin">LXXXVIII. The Third is any Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment freely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken.</note> which for ſins we endure, not as appointed by any Prieſt, but of our own free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord undertaken and laid upon our ſelves, by our ſelves for ſins.</p>

                     </label> But this belongs not to Penance as a Sacrament. But that only is to be thought a part of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, which, as we ſaid, is to be paid to God for ſins, by the command of the Prieſt: This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing added, That we ſtedfaſtly purpoſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve in our Hearts, with our utmoſt labor and care to avoid ſin for the Future.</p>

                     <q>To ſatisfie, is to pay due Honor to God: But it is ſufficiently evident that no one can give due Honor to God, but he that reſolves to avoid ſin by all means.</q> And to ſatisfie, is to cut oft the Cauſes of ſins, and not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge any entrance to their Suggeſtions.</p>
                  <p>According to which Sentence,<note place="margin">Mark this Definition.</note> ſome have thought that Satisfaction is a Cleanſing, whereby what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Uncomelineſs by reaſon of Stain, remains in the Soul, is waſh'd away, and we are abſolv'd from the Temporal Puniſhments wherewith we were held.</p>

For they are to be taught that there are two things which follow ſin, to wit, Stain and Puniſhment: And altho together with the Fault committed, the Puniſhment of Eternal Death with the Damn'd be forgiven: Yet it does not always happen, as has bin declar'd by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>

And this he begg'd with moſt earneſt Prayers: Yet the Lord afflicted him, Both with the Death of the Child gotten in Adultery, and with the Rebellion and Death of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> whom
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:63052:154"/> he dearly lov'd, and with other Puniſhments and Calamities, which he had before threatned him with.

And it becomes the Divine Mercy, that our ſins ſhould not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given us without any Satisfaction: That taking that occaſion, thinking our ſins to be more light than they are, as thoſe that are injurious and contumelious to the Holy Spirit, we fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to greater ſins, <hi>treaſuring up to our ſelves Wrath againſt the day of Wrath.</hi>

For, as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> affirms: <q>God deſpiſes not a Contrite and humble Heart; but becauſe for the moſt part the Grief of one Man's Heart is hid from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man, nor does it come forth into the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of other Men, by Words or any other Sign; rightly are the Times of Penance appointed by thoſe who preſide in the Church: That ſo the Church might be ſatisfi'd, in which ſins are remitted.</q>

                  <p>But afterwards there was ſo much abated of the ſeverity of antient Diſcipline,<note place="margin">XCV.

                  <p>And then by this kind of ſuffering Puniſhments we obtain to our ſelves,<note place="margin">XCVI. By Penance we are made like to Chriſt.

                     </note> That in ſin are found Two things, the Blemiſh and the Plague of the Soul; and that that Foulneſs is taken away by the Mercy of God, but that to heal the Plague of ſin, that Care is very neceſſary, which for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is us'd in Penance. For as when a Wound is heal'd, ſome Scars remain, which alſo are to be cur'd; ſo in the Soul, after the ſin is pardon'd, the Relics of ſin remain to be purg'd away. The ſame thing the ſentence of S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirms, when he ſays:<note place="margin">Hom <hi>80.</hi> ad Pop. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och.</note> 
                     <q>It is not enough that the Arrow be drawn out of the Body, but the Wound alſo made by the Arrow is to be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo alſo in the Soul, after the Pardon of ſin receiv'd, the Plague or Sore remaining is to be cur'd by Penance.</q> For very frequently we are taught by S. <hi>Austin,</hi> That in Penance,<note place="margin">In Pſal. <hi>50.</hi> ad haec verba Ecce enim venit.</note> theſe Two things are to be obſerv'd; the Mercy and the Juſtice of God: His Mercy, whereby he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons the Eternal Puniſhments due to ſin: His Juſtice whereby he puniſhes a Man with Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Puniſhments.</p>

                  <p>But how great the Force and Vertue of it is,<note place="margin">XCIX. Whence the Vertue of Penance to ſatisfie and merit, is. Mat. 10.42.</note> may be gather'd from hence, that it wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the merit of the Paſſion of Chriſt our Lord. From whence alſo we get theſe Two very great advantages by our honeſt Actions: The One is, That we merit the Rewards of Immortal Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: So that even a Cup of cold Water, which we give in his Name wants not a Reward: The Other is, That we ſatisfie for our ſins. <hi>Vide de Poenit.

                  <p>Nor does this obſcure the moſt perfect and full Satisfaction of Chriſt our Lord,<note place="margin">C. Our Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not Chriſt's but illuſtrates it.</note> but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it comes to paſs, that it renders it much more clear and bright. For by ſo much the more full does the Grace of Chriſt appear to be; becauſe not only thoſe things are communicated with us which he only merited, but thoſe things alſo, which as the Head over the Members, he has merited and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in the Saints and Juſt men: By which means it is plain, that it comes, that the Juſt and Honeſt Actions of pious Men have ſo much Weight and Dignity in them.</p>
                  <p>For Chriſt our Lord,<note place="margin">CI.

Which Grace al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways goes before, accompanies and follows our Works, and without which we can by no means merit, or ſatisfie God.</p>
                  <p>And ſo it comes to paſs that to the Juſt nothing ſeems to be wanting,<note place="margin">CII. Being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by the Grace of God, all can work their Salvation.</note> when with their Works, which they do by the Power of God, they can ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:63052:156"/> the Divine Law, as far as their Human and Mortal Condition is capable, and get eternal Life, which, to wit, if they depart out of this Life adorn'd with the Grace of God, they may merit: For, it is a noted ſaying of our Savior. <hi>He that ſhall drink of this water that I ſhall give him, ſhall not thirſt forever;</hi>

                  <p>Now there are Two things,<note place="margin">CIII. Two things requir'd to ſatisfaction.</note> eſpecially requir'd in ſatisfaction. The firſt is, that he who ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies be Juſt, and a Friend of God. For theſe Works which are done without Faith and Charity, can by no means be acceptable to God: The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, that ſuch kind of works be undertaken, which of their own Nature bring ſome grief and trouble: For ſeeing they are in recompenſe for paſt ſins, and as <hi>Cyprian</hi> the Martyr ſays, The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers as it were of ſin: It is altogether neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that they have ſome bitterneſs in them;<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> Ep. <hi>3.</hi> post. med.</note> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho it do not always follow, that thoſe who exerciſe them in theſe troubleſome Actions, have ſenſe of grief thereby.</p>
                  <p>For often times either the cuſtom of enduring, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
                     </label> or the heat of Charity to God cauſes, that thoſe things which are moſt grievous to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd, are not at all felt: Nor yet is there any reaſon why thoſe works have not the vertue of ſatisfying. For this is proper to the Children of God to be ſo inflamed with Love and Devotion towards him, that being ſpent with moſt bitter labors, they either feel almoſt no inconvenience, or elſe they bear all things with a moſt chearful Spirit.</p>
                  <p>But the Paſtors ſhall teach,<note place="margin">CIV. The works of Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are Prayer, Faſting, Alms.</note> that every kind of ſatisfaction is to be referr'd to theſe three eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, Prayer, Faſting, Alms, which indeed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to thoſe three ſorts of Goods, of the Soul, of the Body, and thoſe which are call'd outward Goods, all which we have receiv'd of God.

                  <p>SInce the Holy Oracles of Scripture teach us thus,<note place="margin">I. Why this Sacrament is often to be treated of.</note> 
                     <hi>In all thy works remember thy last end, and thou ſhalt not ſin forever:</hi> The Curats are tacitly admoniſh'd, that no time is to be preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of exhorting the Faithful,<note place="margin">Eccl. 7.40.</note> to be daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in the Meditation of Death. But how can the Sacrament of Extream Unction chooſe but have the Memory of that Laſt day join'd with it? Hence we may eaſily underſtand, that this Sacrament muſt often be treated of, not only for this Reaſon, becauſe it is very convenient to open and unfold the Myſteries of thoſe things which belong to Salvation: But alſo becauſe the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful will reſtrain their evil Luſts, when they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in their minds, that there lies upon all a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Dying; wherefore alſo it will ſo come to paſs, that they will feel themſelves leſs troubl'd at the Expectation of Death.</p>
                  <p>But let them give immortal thanks to God,<note place="margin">II. Thanks to be given to God, for the Inſtitution of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> who, as in the Sacrament of Baptiſm, he has laid open to us an entrance to the true Life; ſo alſo when we depart out of this mortal life, that we might have a more ready way to Heaven, he has inſtituted the Sacrament of Extream Unction.</p>
                  <p>That therefore thoſe things which are more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to explain it,<note place="margin">III. Why this Sacrament call'd Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> may be open'd almoſt in the ſame Order which has bin obſerv'd in the other Sacraments: It ſhall firſt be taught, that This Sacrament is therefore call'd Extream Unction, becauſe this of all the Sacred Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which our Lord and Savior com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to his Church, is laſt to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter'd.</p>

                  <p>But this will be made evident,<note place="margin">V. Extream Unction prov'd to be a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> if we attend to the words wherewith St. <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle has declar'd the Law of this Sacrament: <hi>Is any one ſick among you,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with Oyl in the Name of the Lord:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Firſt.</note> 
                     <hi>and the Prayer of Faith ſhall ſave the ſick, and the Lord ſhall eaſe him,</hi>

                     <hi>and if he be in ſins, they ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For,<note place="margin">Secondly.</note> becauſe the Apoſtle affirms, that <hi>ſins are forgiven,</hi> therein he declares the Force and Nature of a Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Now that This was the perpetual Doctrin of the Catholic Church concerning Extream Unction,<note place="margin">Thirdly.</note> both many other Councils teſtifie, and by the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> it has bin declar'd in ſuch a manner,<note place="margin">Seſſ. <hi>43.</hi> de Extrema <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nct. c. <hi>1.</hi> &amp; can. <hi>3.</hi>

                  <p>It is therefore conſtantly to be taught of the Paſtors,<note place="margin">VI. Extream Unction is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> that it is a true Sacrament: and not many, but One: altho it be adminiſter'd with many Unctions (or Anointings) to every one whereof are us'd proper Prayers, and a peculiar Form.</p>
                  <p>It is One;<note place="margin">VII. How Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is One Sacrament.</note> not in continuation of the Parts which may not be divided; but in perfection, of which ſort are all other things which conſiſt of many parts. For as a Houſe which is compos'd of many and divers things, yet is but One only in perfect Form: So the Sacrament, altho it be made up of many Things and Words, yet it is but One ſign, and has the Efficiency of One thing only which it ſignifies.</p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:63052:159"/>
                  <p>Moreover,<note place="margin">VIII. This Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has Matter and Form. Iſai. 5.14.</note> the Curats ſhall teach, what the Parts of this Sacrament are, <hi>The Element,</hi> I ſay, and <hi>The Word:</hi> For theſe things are not paſs'd over by S. <hi>James;</hi> in every one whereof we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their own Myſteries.</p>
                  <p>The Element or Matter whereof,<note place="margin">IX. What the matter is? In the place before cited.</note> as the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils and eſpecially that of <hi>Trent</hi> has decreed, is Oyl conſecrated by a Biſhop, to wit, the Liquor, not preſs'd out of any fat and thick Nature, but out of the Buries of the Olives only.</p>
                  <p>Now this Matter very fitly ſignifies that thing which by Vertue of this Sacrament,<note place="margin">X. How fit this matter is.</note> is inwardly wrought in the Soul; for as Oyl is very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to mitigate the Pains of the Body: So the Vertue of the Sacrament leſſens the ſorrow and grief of the Soul.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, Oyl reſtores ſweetneſs, makes chearful, and feeds our Lights, and alſo it is very ſuitable to refreſh and ſtrengthen a weary Body. All which things declare, what by the Divine Power is wrought upon a ſick man thro the Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>And This concerning the Matter is ſufficient:<note place="margin">XI. What the Form of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is.</note> But the Form of this Sacrament, is the Word and that ſolemn Prayer which the Prieſt uſes at every Anointing, when he ſays; <q>
                        <hi>God indulge</hi> (or pardon) <hi>thee by this Holy Vnction whatſoever offence thou haſt done thro the fault of thy Eyes, or Noſtrils, or Touch.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that This is the true and proper Form of this Sacrament,<note place="margin">XII. This prov'd to be the proper Form.</note> the Apoſtle S. <hi>James</hi> ſignifies, when he ſays, <hi>Let them pray over him, and the Prayer of Faith ſhall ſave the ſick:</hi> Whence we know, that the Form is to be us'd in manner of a Prayer: altho with what Words chiefly it is to be conceiv'd the Apoſtle has not expreſs'd.</p>
                  <p>But This we have from the Tradition of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:<note place="margin">XIII. This Form us'd every where.</note> So that all Churches retain this manner of Form, which the Roman Church, the Mother and Miſtreſs of all Churches uſes.</p>
                  <p>For tho' ſome change ſome few Words, as when for, <hi>God indulge thee:</hi> They put <hi>Remit</hi> or <hi>Spare,</hi> and ſometimes alſo <hi>Heal
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:63052:160"/> whatſoever thou haſt committed:</hi> But yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no alteration of the ſenſe, it is evident that the ſame Form is religiouſly obſerv'd of all.</p>
                  <p>Nor let any one wonder why it is ſo,<note place="margin">XIV. Why this Form is in the manner of a Prayer.</note> that the Form of other Sacraments either abſolutely ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies what it effects, as when we ſay, <hi>I Baptize thee,</hi> or <hi>I Sign thee with the ſign of the Croſs,</hi> or is pronounc'd, as it were, by commanding; as when in adminiſtring the Sacrament of Orders it is ſaid, <hi>Receive thou Power:</hi> But this One Form of Extream Unction is perform'd in a kind of Prayer; but this is very properly and rightly done, for ſeeing this Sacrament is therefore us'd, that beſides the ſpiritual Grace that it gives, it alſo reſtores Health to the Sick: yet becauſe it does not always follow, that the Sick are made whole of their Diſeaſe; for this cauſe the Form is made in a Prayer, that we may beg that of Gods Bounty, which the Power or Vertue of the Sacrament is not us'd to effect in a conſtant and perpetual courſe.</p>
                  <p>Now there are proper Rites us'd in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of this Sacrament alſo. But the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of them contains Prayers,<note place="margin">XV. Why ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prayers us'd in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> which the Prieſt uſes, to obtain Health for the ſick Perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For there is no Sacrament which is made with more Prayers: and indeed rightly; becauſe at that time eſpecially the Faithful are to be aſſiſted with Pious Devotions: Wherefore alſo all the reſt who then happen to be preſent, and ſpecially the Curat, ought from their heart to beſeech God for the ſick Perſon, and with all their ſtudy and affection to commit his Life and Health to Gods Mercy.</p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing it has bin ſhew'd that Extream Unction is truly and properly to be reckon'd in the number of the Sacraments:<note place="margin">XVI.

                  <p>But this is ſpecially to be obſerv'd, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> that the Prieſt in this Adminiſtration, as it is in the other Sacraments alſo, carries the Perſon of Chriſt, and of the Holy Church, his Spouſe.</p>
                  <p>The Advantages alſo of this Sacrament are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to be explain'd:<note place="margin">XXVIII. The Fruit of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> That if nothing els would draw the people to the uſe thereof, they may be led by the very advantage of it; ſeeing it is ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd as that we may turn almoſt all things to our own profit.</p>
                  <p>The Paſtors therefore ſhall teach,<note place="margin">The Firſt.</note> that in this Sacrament Grace is given, which forgives ſins, and ſpecially the Leſſer, and as they are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call'd, Venial: For Deadly Sins are taken away by the Sacrament of Penance, For neither was this primarily inſtituted for the Remiſſion of Greater Sins: but Baptiſm only, and Penance, effect This.</p>
                  <p>There is another Advantage of Sacred Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;<note place="margin">The Second.</note> that it frees the Soul from Sickneſs and Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity which it has contracted by Sin, and from all the other Relics of Sin. But that time is to be thought moſt ſeaſonable for this Cure, when we are afflicted with any grievous Sickneſs, and our Life is in danger. For it is natural to Man, to fear nothing in the World ſo much as Death. Now the Remembrance of former ſins very much increaſes this Fear, eſpecially when the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence moſt ſharply accuſes: For as it is written:<note place="margin">Sap. 4.21.</note> 
                     <hi>The Fearful ſhall come into the Conſideration of their Sins, and their Iniquities ſhall ſtand up againſt them.</hi> And then the Care and Thought grievouſly preſſes them, that ſhortly after they muſt ſtand before the Tribunal of God, from whom we muſt receive a moſt juſt Sentence, according as we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd.
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:63052:162"/> But it often happens, that the Faithful being ſtrick'n with this Fear, feel themſelves wonderfully puzzl'd.</p>
                  <p>But there is nothing conduces more to the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of Death,<note place="margin">The Third.</note> than to caſt away ſorrow, and cheerfully to wait for the Lords coming, and to be ready willingly to reſtore what he has intruſted us with, whenſoever he pleaſes to call for it from us. That therefore the Minds of the Faithful be freed from this Trouble, and that the Soul be fill'd with a pious and Holy Joy, The Sacrament of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream-Unction brings to paſs.</p>
                  <p>Beſides,<note place="margin">The Fourth.</note> from hence we get another, which may well ſeem the greateſt of all: For tho the Enemy of Mankind, never ceaſes as long as we live, to endeavor our Ruin and Deſtruction; yet that he might deſtroy us, and if he could poſſibly bring it about, that he might take from us all Hope of God's Mercy, he never uſes his utmoſt might and main more violently than when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives we draw towards our End. Wherefore there is Strength and Weapons miniſter'd to the Faithful in this Sacrament, wherewith they may break the Force and Violence of the Adverſary, and ſtoutly fight againſt him. For the Soul of the Sick is eas'd and encourag'd with the Hope of Gods Goodneſs; and being confirm'd therewith, ſhe lightly endures all Inconveniencies, and more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily eſcapes the Wiles and Subtilties of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, endeavouring treacherouſly to inſnare her.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">The Fifth.</note> follows Health of Body alſo, if it be good for him.</p>
                  <p>But if at ſuch Time,<note place="margin">XXIX. Why this Sacrament not ſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual as ir might be.</note> the Sick Recover not their Health, this comes not by the Fault of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but it muſt be believ'd to come to paſs for this Reaſon, becauſe in a great part The Faith either of thoſe, who are anointed with Sacred Oyl, or of thoſe by whom it is adminiſter'd, is weak. For the Evangeliſt teſtifies,<note place="margin">Mat. 13.38.</note> 
                     <hi>That the Lord did not do many mighty works among his own Countrymen, becauſe of their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi> Altho it may truly be ſaid, That Chriſtian Religion, by how much the deeper it has taken Root in the Souls of Men
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:63052:163"/> does ſtand in leſs need of the proof of ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles as theſe, than formerly in the Infancy of the Church it ſeem'd to do.</p>
                  <p>But yet our Faith is here to be excited. For,<note place="margin">XXX. The Faith and Hope of the Sick to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd.</note> Howſoever, by the Will and Counſel of God, it ſhall happen to the Health of the Body; yet the Faithful ought to be ſtrengthen'd with an aſſur'd Hope, that by vertue of the Sacred Oyl, they ſhall get Spiritual Health; and that it ſhall be, that if it chance that they go out of this Life, they ſhall have the benefit of that excellent Word;<note place="margin">Apoc. 14.13</note> 
                     <hi>Bleſſed are the Dead, which dye in the Lord.</hi> Thus much has bin ſpoken briefly concerning the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Extream Unction.

                  <p>Theſe things being explain'd,<note place="margin">X.

Now this Power is double. Of Order and of Juriſdiction.

                  <p>But this Power very much excels that,<note place="margin">XIII. How great this Power of Order is.</note> which in the Law of Nature, is given to other Men, who took care of Sacred Matters. <hi>Vide de Conſecr. diſt.</hi> 2. <hi>cap. Nihil in Sacrific. Conc. Trid.

                  <p>For it muſt needs be that that Age,<note place="margin">XIV. There were Prieſts by the Law of Nature.</note> which was before the Law was written, had her Prieſthood and her ſpiritual Power, ſince it is ſufficiently manifeſt that ſhe had a Law. For theſe Two are ſo cloſely join'd together, as the Apoſtle teſtifies that the One being taken away, it muſt needs be, that the other muſt be taken away alſo. Seeing therefore that by natural Inſtinct Men know that God is to be worſhipp'd; it conſequently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, that in every Common-wealth, ſome ſhould be plac'd over the charge of Sacred Things and the Worſhip of God, whoſe Power in ſome ſort might be call'd Spiritual.</p>
                  <p>This Power the Iſraelites had,<note place="margin">XV. Chriſt's Prieſthood higher than that of Moſes. Let the Prieſts mark.</note> which tho it were higher in Dignity, than that wherewith the Prieſts were indu'd by the Law of Nature; yet is it to be thought far below the Spiritual Power of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>For this is Heavenly, and excels even all the Power of Angels.</p>
                  <p>For it has its beginning not from the Moſaical Prieſthood,<note place="margin">XVI. This Power is deriv'd from Chriſt.</note> but from Chriſt the Lord, who was a Prieſt, not according to the Order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> but of <hi>Melchizedech.</hi> For he it is that being indu'd with the ſupream Power of Giving Grace, and Forgiving ſins, has left this Power, altho definite in Vertue, and ty'd to the Sacraments, to his Church.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore to exerciſe or perform this Matter,<note place="margin">XVII. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Church call'd the Sacrament of Order.</note> certain Miniſters are appointed and conſecrated in a ſolemn religious manner, which Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is call'd, <hi>The Sacrament of Order,</hi> or <hi>Sacred
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:63052:166"/> Ordination.</hi> But it pleas'd the Holy Fathers to uſe This Word, becauſe it has a very large ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſhew the Dignity and Excellency of the Miniſters of God.</p>
                  <p>For Order,<note place="margin">XVIII. What Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is.</note> if we take the proper Force and Notion of it, is the Diſpoſition of Superior and Inferior things, which are ſo ſuited among themſelves, as that One may be referr'd to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Whereas therefore in this Miniſtry there are many Degrees and divers Functions;<note place="margin">XIX.

                     </note> the Holy Synod of <hi>Trent</hi> has prov'd by that reaſon which has often bin repeated: For whereas a Sacrament is a ſign of a Sacred Thing, but that, which in this Conſecration is outward, ſignifies Grace and Power, which is given to him that is conſecrated; it very plainly follows, that Order is truly and properly to be call'd a Sacrament, <hi>That Order is a Sacrament; ſee Trid.

When and by whom this Power is conferr'd.</note> and a Paten with Bread, to him that is to be Ordain'd a Prieſt, ſaying: <hi>Take thou power of offering Sacrifice,</hi> &amp;c. by which words, the Church has always taught, while the Matter is exhibited, that the <hi>Power of Conſecrating the Euchariſt,</hi> a Character being impreſs'd on the Soul, is deliver'd; to which is adjoin'd Grace, rightly and lawfully to diſcharge that Office: Which thing the Apoſtle declares in theſe words:<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.9.</note> 
                     <hi>I admoniſh thee, that thou ſtir up the Grace of God which is in thee, by the Impoſition of my hands: for God has not given us the Spirit of Fear, but of Power, and of Love, and of Sobriety.</hi>

                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:63052:166"/>
                  <p>And now to uſe the words of Sacred Synod, ſince the Adminiſtration of ſo great a Prieſthood is ſo Divine a thing, that it might be exercis'd ſo much the more worthily, and with ſo much the greater Veneration, it was fit, that in the moſt comely and orderly Diſpoſition of the Church, there ſhould be many and divers Orders in the Church, who by their Office might ſerve the Prieſthood: and thoſe indeed who thus are diſtributed, are now to be known by their being ſhav'd in the manner of Clerks, and aſcend thro the leſſer to the greater Orders.</p>
                  <p>It ſhall therefore be taught that theſe Orders are ſeven in number,<note place="margin">XXII. How many Orders of Miniſters of the Church, and what they are.</note> as has always bin taught in the Catholic Church, the Names whereof are theſe, <hi>Door-keeper, Reader, Exorciſt, Acolyt, Sub-deacon, Deacon, Prieſt.

                  <p>Now of theſe there are ſome Greater,<note place="margin">XXIV.

The Greater or Sacred, are the Orders of Prieſthood, of Deaconſhip, and Sub-deaconſhip. To the Leſſer Orders are referr'd the Acolyts, Exorciſts, Readers and Door-keepers, of all which ſeverally we will ſay a little, that the Curats may have wherewith to inſtruct thoſe chiefly whom they know are to be receiv'd into any Holy Order.</p>
                  <p>And we muſt begin at the Firſt ſhaving,<note place="margin">XXV. What the firſt ſhaving is.</note> which muſt be taught to be a kind of Preparation to Orders. For as men are us'd to be prepar'd for Baptiſm by Exorciſms, and for Matrimony by Betrothing: So when by ſhaving the Hair of the Head, they are dedicated to God, there is an
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:63052:167"/> Entrance, as it were open'd them to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Order: For it is declar'd what kind of perſon he ought to be, who deſires to receive Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.</p>

                  <p>He ought alſo to call over the names of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumens, and to place thoſe before the Biſhop, who were to be initiated in the Sacrament of Order.</p>

                  <p>In the Fourth Degree are plac'd Patriarchs,<note place="margin">The Fourth of Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs.</note>

                  <p>Above all theſe the Catholic Church has always had a Veneration for the Roman Chief Biſhop or Pope,<note place="margin">The Fifth of Supream Biſhop or Pope.</note> whom in the Council of <hi>Epheſus, Cyril</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> calls the <hi>Father and Patriarch of the whole World.</hi> For ſince he ſits in the Chair of <hi>Peter</hi> the Prince of Apoſtles, wherein it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that he ſat to the end of his life, ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges in him, the Supreme degree of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and fulneſs of Juriſdiction, not as given by any Synodical or Human Conſtitutions, but of God: Wherefore he being Father and Governor of all the Faithful, and of the Biſhops alſo and other Prelates, with what Office or Power ſoever they be endu'd, preſides over the Univerſal Church, as <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſor and the true and lawful Vicar of Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Of the Primacy of the Pope, ſee Anatol.

                  <p>For it is evident that this Adminiſtration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to a Biſhop,<note place="margin">L. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of this Sacrament is the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.</note> which is eaſie to prove, both from the Authority of the Sacred Scriptures, and moſt certain Tradition, the Teſtimony of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Decrees of Councils, and the Uſage and Practice of Holy Church. But tho it be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſome Abbots to adminiſter the Leſſer, but not Sacred Orders; yet there is no one doubts that this Office is properly the Biſhop's, to whom only of all the reſt, and beſides him, to no body elſe, it is lawful to receive into the other Orders which are call'd the Greater and Sacred. For only the Biſhop and he alone ordains Subdeacons and Prieſts: but the Biſhops, by the Tradition of the Apoſtles, which has always bin preſerv'd in the Church, are conſecrated by Three Biſhops.</p>
                  <p>It now follows to explain,<note place="margin">LI. Get care to be us'd in receiving an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

From hence it will not be hard to determin what ought to be obſerv'd, in the giving of other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, according to the Office and Dignity of each of them. Now that there is very great caution to be us'd in this Sacrament, is thus gather'd; becauſe the other Sacraments give Grace to the Sanctification and Uſe of them by whom they are receiv'd: But thoſe that are admitted into Sacred Order, are therefore partakers of Heavenly Grace, that by their Miniſtery they may help forward the Salvation of the Church, and consequently of all Men.</p>
                  <p>Whence we underſtand it comes to paſs, that upon certain appointed days only, when accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the moſt antient practice of the Catholic Church, ſolemn Faſtings are appointed, Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are perform'd; to wit; that the Faithful People with Devout and Holy Prayers might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech of God that the Miniſters of ſuch kind of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred things, might be render'd more fit to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:63052:172"/> ſo great a Power as they ought to do, and to the profit of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore integrity of Manners is very much commendable in him that is to be made a Prieſt,<note place="margin">LII. Integrity of Life neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Prieſt.</note> not only becauſe, if being conſcious to himſelf of any mortal ſin, he procure or but even ſuffer himſelf to be receiv'd into Sacred Order; he intangles himſelf in a new, and a moſt extream wickedneſs: But alſo becauſe he ought to ſhew himſelf a Light and a Guide of Vertue and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to others. For this cauſe, what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle commanded <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothy;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 1 Tim. 3.</note> is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd to the Paſtors; and alſo it is to be taught, That the Deformities of the Body, which in the Old-Law by the commandment of the Lord, exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any from the Miniſtery of the Altar, in the Evangelical Law, is ſpecially to be apply'd to the deformity of Mind. Wherefore we conſider that that Holy Cuſtom is preſerv'd in the Church, that they who are to be ordain'd, endeavor diligently, firſt to purge their Conſciences by the Sacrament of Penance.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore,<note place="margin">LIII. Knowledg alſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to a Prieſt.</note> there is requir'd in a Prieſt, not that knowledg only which belongs to the Uſe and Miniſtring of the Sacraments, but he ought alſo to be ſo furniſh'd with the knowledg of Sacred Scripture, that he might be able to teach the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Chriſtian Faith, and the Precepts of the Divine Law to the People, and ſtir up the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Vertue and Piety, and reclaim them from Vice. For there are Two Functions of a Prieſt: Whereof the One is, that he rightly make and adminiſter the Sacraments: The other that he inſtruct the people committed to his charge in thoſe matters and things which are neceſſary to Salvation. For <hi>Malachy</hi> teſtifies,<note place="margin">Mal. 2.7.</note> 
                     <hi>The Prieſts Lips preſerve knowledg, and they require the Law from his Mouth: Becauſe he is the Angel of the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> As therefore in one of theſe, tho he be qualifi'd bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:63052:173"/> matters, is not equally requir'd in all Prieſts, but that which is ſufficient for every one, for the diſcharge of his own proper Office and Miniſtery.</p>
                  <p>Now this Sacrament is not to be given to Boys, Furious or Mad-men,<note place="margin">LIV. Boys, Furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Mad-men, not to be ordain'd.</note> becauſe they want the Uſe of Reaſon, altho if it were adminiſter'd even to them alſo, it ought certainly to be believ'd that the Character of this Sacrament, is imprinted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Souls.</p>

                     <q>Matrimony is a Conjugal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of a Man and a Woman, between two lawful perſons, holding an individual nearneſs of life.</q> The parts of which Definition, that they may the better be underſtood, it muſt be taught, that altho all theſe things are in perfect Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to wit, Inward Conſent, Outward Agreement or Pact expreſs'd by Words, Obligation and Bond, which is made by vertue of the Pact, and the Copulation of Husband and Wife, whereby the Matrimony is conſummate; yet nothing of theſe has properly the Nature and Vertue of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, unleſs that Obligation and Knot which is ſignifi'd by the word Conjunction.</p>
                  <p>The word Conjugal is added becauſe other kinds of Compacts whereby Men and Women are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd mutually to help each other,<note place="margin">Conjugal.</note> either for Mony, or for any other reſpect, are far from the Nature of Matrimony.</p>
                  <p>Then follows,<note place="margin">Between lawful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> 
                     <hi>Between lawful perſons,</hi> becauſe they who by the Laws are wholly excluded from the Conjunction of Marriage, cannot enter into Matrimony: Nor, if they ſhould marry, is their Marriage valid: for Example, thoſe who are join'd in kindred within the fourth degree, and a Youth before the fourteenth year of his Age, or a Girl, before her twelfth, which is the Age eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by Law, ſuch perſons are not fit to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the juſt Covenants of Matrimony.</p>
                  <p>But that which is put in the laſt place [Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an individual nearneſs of life] declares the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an indiſſoluble Bond,<note place="margin">Indiſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> wherewith the Husband and Wife are ty'd together.</p>
                  <p>From theſe things therefore it is plain,<note place="margin">VI. Wherein eſpecially the vertue of Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is plac'd.</note> that the Nature and Reaſon of Matrimony conſiſts in that Bond.

                        </gap>n.</note> This is ſo to be underſtood, that that Conſent is the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſe of Matrimony: which thing the Fathers in the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> have taught: for Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation and Tye cannot be, without Conſent and Compact.</p>
                  <p>But it is very neceſſary,<note place="margin">VII. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the p eſent time to be expreſs'd by words.</note> that the Conſent be expreſs'd in words which ſignifie the preſent Time: For, neither is Matrimony a ſimple Donation, but a mutual Compact. And therefore it is, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of One only is not to join Matrimony, but there muſt be a mutual Conſent of Two betwixt themſelves: And for the declaring of this mutual Conſent of mind, it is evident that there is need of <hi>Words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For if Matrimony could conſiſt in the inward Conſent only without any outward ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;<note place="margin">VIII. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent not enough for Matrimony.</note> then this alſo would ſeem to follow: that when Two, who were ſever'd far aſunder and in different places, would conſent to marry, before the One had declar'd his Will to the other, either by Letters or Meſſengers, they would be join'd together in a true and laſting Matrimony: which notwithſtanding is very far both from Reaſon and from the Practice and Decrees of Holy Church.</p>
                  <p>It is rightly ſaid therefore,<note place="margin">IX. Conſent of preſent in words of future time no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</note> that the Conſent muſt be expreſs'd in words, which have the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the preſent time; for thoſe words which ſhew a future time do not conjoin Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, but promiſe only; and then, it is evident that thoſe things which are future, are not yet: but thoſe things which are not, muſt be thought to have little or nothing of firmneſs or ſtability in them. Wherefore as yet, no one has a Right of the Marriage Bed with that Woman, which he promiſes that he will marry, nor is it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fulfill'd what he promiſes he will do; altho he ought to perform his promiſe: which if he perform not, he is convicted as guilty of breach of Faith. But he that is join'd to another in the Covenant of Matrimony; altho afterwards he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent:
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:63052:175"/> yet what is done, he cannot alter, or make void or ineffectual. Since therefore the Obligation of Wedlock is not a bare Promiſe, but ſuch a kind of abal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>enation, or transferring over a Right, whereby a man delivers indeed the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Body to the Woman, and the Woman the power of her's to the Man; therefore it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that Matrimony be contracted with words which ſignifie the preſent time. The Vertue and Force of which words, remain even after they are pronounc'd, and hold the Man and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man bound together with an indiſſoluble Bond.</p>
                  <p>But yet inſtead of Words, a Nod with the Head,<note place="margin">X. A Nod or other ſigns may ſuffice inſtead of Words.</note> or other ſigns, which plainly ſhew the inward Conſent, may be ſufficient for Matrimony: yea, even ſilence it ſelf, when a Maid by reaſon of Modeſty anſwers not, but her Parents ſpeak for her. From theſe things therefore the Curats ſhall teach the Faithful, that the Nature and Force of Matrimony lies in the Bond and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And beſides the Conſent, expreſs'd in that manner as has now bin ſaid, that Matrimony might be true, the Bed is not neceſſary:<note place="margin">Gen 2.</note> For it is plainly manifeſt, that our firſt Parents before they had ſinn'd, all which time there had bin no car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal copulation betwixt them, as the Fathers te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, were join'd together in true Matrimony. Wherefore the Holy Fathers ſay, that Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtands not in the Marriage-Bed, but in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: which we find repeated alſo by S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> in his Book concerning Virgins, <hi>De Inſt.

                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">XII. Natural Matrimony inſtituted of God.</note> therefore the Faithful are to be taught that Matrimony was inſtituted of God. For it is written in <hi>Geneſis: God created them Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, and bleſs d them; and ſaid: Increaſe and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> And, <hi>It is not good that Man be alone, let us make him an help like himſelf.</hi> And a little after: <hi>But there was not found for Adam an help like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, therefore the Lord God, ſent a deep ſleep upon Adam; and while he ſlept, he took one of his Ribs, and clos'd up the Fleſh inſtead thereof. And the Lord God form'd the Rib that he took from Adam into a Woman, and brought her to Adam, and Adam ſaid, This now is bone of my bones, and fleſh of my fleſh; ſhe ſhall be call'd Woman, becauſe ſhe was taken out of Man: Wherefore a Man ſhall leave his Father and Mother, and ſhall cleave to his Wife, and they Two ſhall be One Fleſh.</hi> Which things,<note place="margin">Mat. 19.6.</note> even by the Authority of our Lord himſelf in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> ſhew that Matrimony was of Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
                  <p>Nor did God inſtitute Matrimony only,<note place="margin">XIII.

He that loves his Wife, loves himſelf: for no one ever hated his own fleſh, but nouriſhes and cheriſhes it, even as Chriſt does the Church, becauſe we are Members of his Body, of his Fleſh, and of his Bones.

                  <p>But among the Jews the Laws of Matrimony were much more religiouſly obſerv'd;<note place="margin">XXIII.

                  <p>To this may be added,<note place="margin">XXIV. Matrimony before and under the Law was imperfect. Deut. 24.1.

                  <p>By which words he has made it evident,<note place="margin">XXVI. Matrimony is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of Two only.</note> that Matrimony was ſo inſtituted of God, that it ſhould be defin'd in a Conjunction of Two only and no more.

                  <p>For first,<note place="margin">Firſt.</note> Men ſhould know, that in joining Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, Vertue and Likeneſs of Manners are to be regarded, rather than Riches and Beauty.

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:63052:179"/> Wife is cut off; for this cauſe it is that they are ſlower to anger and diſcord.</p>
                  <p>But if ſometimes they proceed to make Divorce,<note place="margin">Fourthly.</note> and yet cannot long endure the want of a Mate, they are eaſily reconcil'd by Friends, and return to each other.</p>
                  <p>But here the wholſome Admonition of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> is not to be paſs'd over by the Paſtors:<note place="margin">

                     <note place="margin">Prov. 18.12.</note> For that the Scripture calls him a Fool who keeps an Adultreſs, it means of her, which when ſhe has offended, repents not, and refuſes to leave off the filthineſs ſhe has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun. From theſe things therefore it is plain, that the Marriages of the Faithful far excel the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages both of the Gentiles and of the Jews in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Nobility.</p>
                  <p>The Faithful are further to be taught,<note place="margin">XXX. Three Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of Matrimony.</note> that there are three Benefits of Matrimony; Children, Faith, Sacrament: By recompenſe of which thoſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies are leſſen'd which the Apoſtle ſhews in theſe words:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.28.</note> 
                     <hi>They that are married ſhall have Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation of the Fleſh.</hi> And thereby it comes to paſs that the Conjunction of Bodies, which without Matrimony are worthily condemn'd, is render'd honeſt. <hi>Vide Aug. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cont.

                  <p>The Firſt Good therefore is Children,<note place="margin">The Firſt.</note> which are begotten of a juſt and lawful Wife; for this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle reckons ſo much of,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.25.</note> that he ſaid. <hi>The Woman ſhall be ſav'd by the begetting of Children.</hi> Nor is this to be underſtood only of the Begetting of Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, but alſo of the Education and diſcipline of them, whereby Children are inſtructed in Piety. So the Apoſtle preſently adds: <hi>If they remain in Faith.</hi> The Scripture alſo admoniſhes:<note place="margin">Eccle. 7.25.</note> 
                     <hi>Haſt thou Children? teach them and bend them from their Childhood.</hi> The

                  <p>Now follows Faith,<note place="margin">The Second.</note> which is another Benefit of Matrimony, not that Habit of Vertue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we are tinctur'd when we receive Baptiſm, but a kind of Fidelity wherewith the Husband binds himſelf to his Wife, and the Wife mutually binds her ſelf to her Husband, and that in ſuch a manner, that each of them deliver the power of their Bodies to each other, and promiſes never to violate the Holy Covenant of Marriage. This is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily gather'd from thoſe words utter'd by our firſt Father,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.24.</note> when he receiv'd <hi>Eve</hi> his Wife, and which Chriſt our Lord afterwards approv'd in the Goſpel. <hi>Wherefore a Man ſhall leave his Father and Mother, and cleave to his Wife, and they Two ſhall be One Fleſh:</hi> Alſo from that place of the Apoſtle.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.4.</note>

                     </label> that the Husband and Wife be joyn'd together in a kind of ſingular, holy and pure love, nor may they love as Adulterers do among themſelves, but as Chriſt lov'd the Church. For this Rule the Apoſtle preſcrib'd,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3.25.</note> when he ſaid: <hi>Men love your Wives as Chriſt alſo lov'd the Church,</hi> which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he embrac'd with that immenſe Charity, not for his own profits ſake, but propoſing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the advantage only of his Bride.</p>
                  <p>The Third Good of Matrimony is call'd the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,<note place="margin">The Third.</note> to wit, the Bond of Marriage, from which they can never be diſſolv'd:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.19.</note> For as the Apoſtle has it; <hi>The Lord has commanded that the Wife depart not from her own Husband:</hi> But if ſhe
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:63052:180"/> depart, that ſhe remain unmarri'd, or be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd to her Husband, and that the Husband put not away his Wife. For if Matrimony, as it is a Sacrament ſignifie the Conjunction of Chriſt with his Church: it muſt needs be, that as Chriſt never ſeparates himſelf from his Church; ſo a Wife, as to the Bond of Matrimony, can never be ſeparated from her Husband. But that this holy Society may be the better preſerv'd without Quarrel; the Duties of the Husband and of the Wife, as they are deſcrib'd by S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>Peter</hi> the Prince of Apoſtles, are to be taught. <hi>Vide Aug. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Adulterin. conjug. c.</hi> 21. &amp; 22. &amp; <hi>de bono Conjug. c.</hi> 7. &amp; <hi>de Nupt.</hi> &amp; <hi>concupiſc. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 10.</p>

                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The firſt.</note> that Marriage is not to be enterpriz'd for Pleaſure or Luſt's ſake: but they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the Lord to uſe it within thoſe limits, which we have ſhew'd before.

                     <hi>They that have Wives, let them be, as tho they had not.</hi> And alſo what is ſaid by S. <hi>Hierom:</hi> 
                     <q>A wiſe man ought to love his Wife with judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the violence of Pleaſure reigns not with Paſſion, nor will he be carried head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to embraces.</q> There is nothing more fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy than for a man to love his Wife as an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultreſs.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe all good things are to be ſought of God with Holy Prayers;<note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> there is another thing which the Faithful muſt be taught, that for the ſake of praying and beſeeching God, they ſometimes abſtain from the Office of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony: And firſt let them know, that this is to be obſerv'd by them for three days at leaſt before they receive the Sacred Euchariſt, but more when they celebrate the ſolemn Faſts of Lent, even as our Fathers have well and holily appointed. For ſo it will come to paſs that they ſhall feel thoſe benefits of Matrimony increas'd daily with a greater heap of Divine Grace, and following the ſtudy of Piety, they ſhall not only paſs away this life in Tranquility and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but they ſhall be confirm'd with the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and ſure Hope, of obtaining life eternal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by the Goodneſs of God, which hope will

And amongſt other things which may well drive men to the Obſervance of the Commands of this Law, This has very great
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:63052:184"/> force, That God is the Author of this Law. For tho it be ſaid to be given by Angels;<note place="margin">Gal. 13.29.</note> yet no one can doubt, that God himſelf is the Author of the Law. Of the truth whereof, not only the Words of the Lawgiver himſelf, which ſhall by and by be explain'd, afford ſufficient teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but almoſt infinite other places of Scripture, which the Paſtors will eaſily meet with.</p>
                  <p>For there is no one who feels not,<note place="margin">V. God the Author of the Law of Nature.</note> that a Law is implanted in his Soul by God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he can diſcern good from evil, that which is honeſt from that which is diſhonest, what is juſt from what is unjuſt. The force and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of which Law, ſeeing it differs not from that which is written who is there that dares deny, that God is the Author, as of the inward, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the written Law?</p>
                  <p>Therefore when God gave the Law to <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">VI. Why he gave the Written Law.</note> it muſt be taught that he rather made this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light, which by ill manners and daily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs was now almoſt darkn'd, much more il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious, than that he gave a new one, leſt happly the People hearing the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpoken ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverently of, might think themſelves not bound to the Obſervation of it.</p>
                  <p>For moſt certain it is that we are not to obey theſe Commandments becauſe they were given by <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">VII. Why we muſt obey the Laws of the Decalog.</note> but becauſe they are implanted in our Souls, and are explain'd and confirmed by Chriſt our Lord.</p>
                  <p>Now this Conſideration will help much,<note place="margin">VIII. Obedience to the Law of God how to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd.</note> and has great force to perſwade, that it is God who made this Law: Of whoſe Wiſdom and Juſtice we cannot doubt, nor can we eſcape his infinite Power and Vertue. Wherefore when by the Prophets God commanded that the Law ſhould be obſerv'd, he ſaid, that he was the Lord God; and in the beginning of the Decalog, <hi>I am the Lord thy God:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 20.1.</note> and elſewhere;<note place="margin">Malach. 1.6.</note> 
                     <hi>If I am a Lord, where is my Fear?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that God has declar'd his Will,<note place="margin">IX. God to be thanked for the giving of the Law.</note> wherein is contain'd our Salvation, will ſtir up the minds of the Faithful, not only to keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:63052:184"/> of God, but alſo to be thankful to him. And therefore the Scripture in many places decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this very great Benefit, warns people to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve its Dignity, and God's Beneficence, as in <hi>Deuteronomy:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 4.6.</note> This, ſays it, is your Wiſdom and your Underſtanding before the People; that all hearing theſe Commandments, may ſay, <hi>This is a wiſe and an underſtanding People, and a great Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And again in the Pſalms:<note place="margin">Pſal. 147.10.</note> 
                     <hi>He has not dealt ſo with every Nation, and he has not manifeſted his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if the Curat ſhall moreover declare the manner of the giving of the Law from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scripture,<note place="margin">X. With how great Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty the Law was given.</note> the Faithful will eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, how piouſly and humbly they ought to honor or reverence the Law, receiv'd from God himſelf;<note place="margin">Exod. 19.10.</note> for it was commanded of God to all, that Three Days before the giving of the Law, they ſhould waſh their Clothes, and not touch their Wives, that ſo they might be more holy and better prepar'd to receive the Law, and be preſent on the Third Day; and then when they were brought to the Mountain, from whence the Lord by <hi>Moſes</hi> was about to deliver the Law, <hi>Moſes</hi> alone was commanded to aſcend up into the Mountain, whither the Lord came with very great Majeſty, and fill'd the place with Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Lightning, with Fire and thick Clouds, and began to ſpeak with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and gave him the Law.</p>
                  <p>Which thing the Divine Wiſdom would not have done,<note place="margin">XI. Why the Law given in this terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner.</note> but to admoniſh us that the Law is to be receiv'd with a pure and humble mind, and if we neglect the Commandments, that Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment hangs over our heads from the Divine Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>And let the Curate ſhew alſo that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the Law are not difficult,<note place="margin">XII. It muſt be ſhew'd that the Law is eaſy. <hi>Aug. Ser.</hi> 47 <hi>de tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore.</hi>

                     <pb n="336" facs="tcp:63052:185"/> But now,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.8.</note> 
                     <hi>He that loves, has fulfill'd the Law.</hi> VVherefore the Apoſtle S. <hi>John</hi> plainly teſtifies,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.3.</note>

                     </note> as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> wittneſſes; and therefore S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> admir'd the exceeding great kindneſs of God, Speaking to God in this manner: <q>VVhat is Man that thou wouldſt be lov'd by him? and if he do not do it, thou threatneſt him mighty pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments?</q> is not this puniſhment great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that I love thee not?</p>
                  <p>But if any one offer this excuſe,<note place="margin">XIII. The excuſe of the Weakneſs of our Nature is vain. Luc. 11.13.</note> that he is hindred thro the Infirmity of Nature, ſo that he cannot love God; it muſt be taught, that God who requires our Love, does implant in our Hearts the Vertue of Love by his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Now thus good <hi>Spirit is given of our Heavenly Father to them that ask it.</hi> So that S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> pray'd well, "Give what thou commandeſt, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand what thou wilt.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe therefore we have Gods help ready at hand,<note place="margin">XIV.

                  <p>Moreover to perſwade the ſame thing it will very much avail,<note place="margin">XV. We all are neceſſarily oblidg'd to the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Law.</note> if it be explain'd, that the Law is neceſſarily to be obey'd: eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our days there are not wanting thoſe who are not affraid wickedly, and to their great hurt, to ſay, That whether the Law be eaſie or difficult, yet it is no ways neceſſary to Salvation.

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:63052:185"/> repeats the ſame Opinion, he ſays that a New Creature only avails in Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.15.</note> we plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtand, that he calls him a Creature in Chriſt, who obſerves God's commandments. For he that has Gods Commandments and keeps them, loves God,<note place="margin">John 14.2.</note> as our Lord himſelf in S. <hi>John</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies: <hi>If any one love me, he will keep my Saying.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">XVI. What Fruits or Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages the Keepers of the Law have.</note> that the Curat may not paſs over any thing, whereby the Faithful may be brought to keep the Law, he ſhall ſhew how large and ſweet the Advantages thereof are: which he may eaſily prove by thoſe things which are written in the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Pſalm: for therein are celebrated the Praiſes of the Law of God; whereof this is very great, which much more largely ſhews the Glory and Majeſty of God, than the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bodies themſelves do by their Beauty and Order, which as they draw all Nations, even the very Barbarous ones into the Admiration of them: So do they force them to acknowledge the Glory, Wiſdom and Power of the Maker and Creator of all things. And indeed, the Law of the Lord converts Souls to God. For knowing his VVays, and what the moſt holy VVill of God is by his Laws, we turn our feet into the VVay of the Lord. And becauſe they only who truly fear God, are VViſe, he has beſtow'd this Power upon it, to give VViſdom to little ones. Hence it is that they who obſerve Gods Law, heap to themſelves true and mighty joys, both in this Life and the Life to come, from the Knowledge of Divine Myſteries.</p>
                  <p>Nor is the Law to be obſerv'd of us ſo much for our own Advantage,<note place="margin">XVII.

                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:63052:186"/>
                  <p>Nor is this to be paſs'd by in ſilence,<note place="margin">XVIII.

That what is profitable to Man, the ſame ſhould be to God's Glory. Now becauſe this thing is very great and excellent, the Curat ſhall teach, as the Prophet in the laſt place ſays: <hi>In keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them there is great reward.</hi> For there are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to us not only thoſe Bleſſings, which ſeem to belong rather to the earthly felicity, that we ſhould be bleſs'd in the City, and bleſs'd in the Field: but there is offer'd a full Reward in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and good meaſure, heap'd and thruſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and running over, which by pious and juſt Actions, by the help of the Divine Mercy, we merit.</p>

                  <p>In the ſecond place,<note place="margin">XI. Here are two Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</note> in the words propos'd there is contain'd a twofold Precept: whereof the One has the Vertue of commanding, and the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Forbidding. For in that it is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not have ſtrange Gods before me.</hi> The meaning is, Thou ſhalt worſhip me the true God, thou ſhalt give no worſhip to ſtrange Gods.</p>
                  <p>In the Firſt is contain'd the Precept of Faith,<note place="margin">XII. What the firſt Part contains.</note> Hope and Charity: For when we ſay that God is immoveable, unchangeable, remains always the ſame, faithful, we confeſs aright, without any fault: whence, aſſenting to his Oracles, we muſt needs attribute all Faith and Authority to him: But he that conſiders his Omnipotency, Mercy and Promptitude, and Propenſity to do good, can he chuſe but place all his Hope in him? But if he contemplate the Riches of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Love ſhed upon us, can he chuſe but

                  <p>Theſe things being explain'd, it muſt be added,<note place="margin">XIV. The firſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Decalogue excels the reſt.</note> That this is the Firſt and Chiefeſt of all the Commandments, not only in Order, but in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Dignity and Excellence. For God ought to have more Love and Authority among us by infinite degrees, than Lord or King.

                  <p>And let no one think, that the Art of Painting, Carving or making Images is forbid by this Commandment:<note place="margin">XXXIII.

<pb n="349" facs="tcp:63052:191"/> ſhould be withdrawn from the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, to the Worſhiping of Images, as Gods.</p>
                  <p>Now as to this Commandment,<note place="margin">XXXIV. Two things here forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Firſt to worſhip Idols.</note> there are two VVays eſpecially, whereby it is evident that the Majeſty of God is very grievouſly offended.</p>
                  <p>The One is, when Idols and Images are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip'd as Gods, or when it is believ'd, that there is any Divinity, or Vertue in them, for which they are to be worſhip'd; or that any thing is to be begg'd of them, or that any Truſt is to be put in them, as of Old the Gentils did, who plac'd their Hopes in Idols, which thing the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures in many places reprove.</p>
                  <p>The Other is,<note place="margin">Secondly, by Art to frame any likeneſs of the Divinty</note> when any one endeavours to make any Shape of the Divinity, as tho he could be ſeen with bodily Eyes, or expreſs'd in Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures. <q>For who, as <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſays, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe God, who cannot be ſeen, who has no Body, who can be circumſcrib'd with no Limits, nor deſcrib'd under any Figure?</q> VVhich thing is more largly explain'd in the Second Council of <hi>Nice. Damaſc. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Ortho. Fid. c.</hi> 17. <hi>Concil. Nicen.</hi> 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Apoſtle ſaid excellently,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.23.</note> 
                     <hi>That they had changed the Glory of the incorruptible God, into the likeneſs of Birds, Beaſts and Serpents:</hi> For they reverenec'd all theſe things as Gods when they put up their Images: wherefore the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites when they proclaim'd before the Image of the Calf:<note place="margin">Exod. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>Theſe are thy Gods, ô Iſrael, which brought thee out of the Land of Egypt,</hi> were call'd Idolaters, <hi>becauſe they chang'd their Glory into the likeneſs of a Calf which eats Hay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When therefore the Lord forbids other Gods to be worſhip'd,<note place="margin">XXXV.

                  <p>Moreover,<note place="margin">XXXVI. It is lawful by ſome fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures to ſhadow out the Trinity.</note> let no one think that any Offence is committed againſt Religion and the Law of God, when any Perſon of the moſt holy Trinity is expreſs'd by certain ſigns, which have appear'd as well in the Old, as in the New Teſtament: For there is none ſo rude, as to think that the Divinity is expreſs'd by that Image: but let the Paſtor teach that by them are declar'd ſome Properties or Actions which are attributed to God: As when by <hi>Daniel</hi> the Ancient of Days is deſcrib'd ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Throne, before whom the Books were opened: there was ſignified Gods Eternity and infinite VViſdom, whereby he beholds all, both the Thoughts and Actions of Men, that he might judge concerning them.</p>

Hence come thoſe ſo frequently repeated Promiſes of God in ſacred Scripture: For, to omit the Teſtimonies of the Old Teſtament, which are almoſt innumerable, it is written in the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Mat. 19.17.5, 6, 7.

                  <p>The other is,<note place="margin">The other is Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> That the Perfect are to be taught this Appendix for a far different Reaſon than Carnal Men are.</p>
                  <p>For,<note place="margin">XLII.

                  <p>God's Jealouſie therefore is his moſt calm and moſt upright Juſtice,<note place="margin">XLVI. God's Zeal defin'd.</note> whereby a Soul corrupted with falſe Perſuaſions and wicked Luſts, is reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and caſt off by God as an Adultereſs.</p>

                  <p>Moreover,<note place="margin">Fifthly.</note> we honor Gods Name, when for more aſſurance and belief we call God to be a witneſs: and this way differs much from the former: For thoſe things which we mentioned before are of their own nature ſo good and excellent, that to Man nothing can be more happy, nothing can be more deſirable, than diligently to exerciſe himſelf Night and Day in performing them: <hi>I will bleſs the Lord,</hi>

Why the frequent uſe of Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidd'n.</note> yet the frequent uſe thereof is not commendable. Now the reaſon of this difference lies herein, that an Oath is appointed for this cauſe only, to be a kind of Remedy of Human Frailty, and a neceſſary means to prove what we ſay.</p>
                  <p>For as it is not fit to take Phyſick for the Body,<note place="margin">A Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there be need, and the frequent uſe thereof is very hurtful: ſo alſo it is not good to uſe any Oath, but when there is ſome juſt and weighty cauſe, which to uſe frequently is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:63052:197"/> profitable, that indeed it is very hurtful.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> excellently teaches,<note place="margin">XI. Whence the Cuſtom of Swearing. <hi>Ad pop. Antioch. hom.</hi> 26.</note> That <q>Not at the beginning of the World, but when it began to grow old, and when Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs had far and wide ſpread it ſelf over the whole Earth, and when nothing contain'd it ſelf in its own Place and Order, but all things being jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together and troubled, were tumbled upſide down, and brought into utter Confuſion; then at laſt after a long time that Cuſtom of Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broke in upon Men: For when Mens Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſneſs and Wickedneſs was grown to that paſs, that no one could eaſily be brought to believe one another, then did they call God as a Witneſs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whereas in this part of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">XII. The firſt way of Swearing.</note> the beſt way is to teach the Faithful how they ought to Swear piouſly and holily; it muſt firſt be ſaid, That to Swear is nothing elſe, but to call God as a Witneſs, by what Form or Conception of Words ſoever it be done: For to ſay, <hi>God it Witneſs,</hi> and <hi>by God,</hi> is the ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>That is alſo an Oath,<note place="margin">XIII. The ſecond way of Swearing.</note> when for more Belief we ſwear by Creatures; as <hi>by the Holy Goſpel of God, by the Croſs, by the Relics of the Saints, their Name,</hi> and ſuch like: Yet theſe things of themſelves give not any Strength or Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to an Oath; but it is God himſelf that does it, the Splendor of whoſe Divine Majeſty ſhines forth in thoſe things. VVhence it follows, that they who Swear by the Goſpel, Swear by God himſelf, whoſe Truth is contain'd and declar'd in the Goſpel: And in like manner they that do Swear by the Saints, who are the Temple of God, and who believ'd the Truth of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and with all Reverence obey'd it and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd it abroad in all Countries and Nations.</p>
                  <p>That Oath that is made with a Curſe,<note place="margin">XIV. The third way of Swearing.</note> is of the ſame nature; ſuch as is that of S. <hi>Paul, I call God to witneſs upon my Soul:</hi> For by this means, he that ſwears thus, ſubjects himſelf to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God as to the Revenger of a Lye. Yet
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:63052:197"/> we deny not therefore that ſome of theſe Forms may ſo be tak'n, as not to have the Force of an Oath; but yet it is uſeful, even in theſe caſes alſo, to obſerve what was ſaid concerning an Oath, and wholly to direct and reduce them to the ſame Rule and Order.</p>
                  <p>Now there are two kinds of an Oath:<note place="margin">XV. An Oath Twofold. Aſſertory.</note> The Firſt is that which is Aſſertory, to wit, when we religiouſly affirm any thing concerning any Matter preſent or paſt, as the Apoſtle in the Epiſtles to the <hi>Galatians:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 1.20.</note> 
                     <hi>Behold before God, I lye not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the other is call'd Promiſſory,<note place="margin">Promiſſory.</note> to which alſo belong Threatnings, and have Ralation to the Time to come. VVhen we certainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and confirm it, that ſuch a thing ſhall be ſo: Of which kind is that of <hi>David,</hi> who ſwearing to <hi>Berſabe</hi> his VVife, by the Lord his God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd that <hi>Solomon</hi> his Son ſhould be the Heir of his Kingdom,<note place="margin">2 Reg. 1 17.</note> and ſucceed him in his room.</p>
                  <p>Now tho to an Oath,<note place="margin">XVI. How many things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd to a lawful Oath.</note> it be ſufficient to uſe God as a VVitneſs, yet to make it juſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there are many more things requir'd, which are diligently to be explain'd; but thoſe things as S. <hi>Jerom</hi> teſtifies, <hi>Jeremy</hi> briefly reckons up, when he ſays:<note place="margin">S. Hierom. in hunc lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum. Hier. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Thou ſhalt ſwear, the Lord lives, in Truth, and in Judgment, and in Juſtice.</hi> In which words are briefly and ſummarily contain'd thoſe things, wherein all the Perfection of an Oath lies, to wit, Truth. Judgment and Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Truth therefore has the firſt Place in an Oath,<note place="margin">XVII What it is to Swear in aſſerting Truth.</note> to wit, that what is aſſerted be the very Truth, and that he that ſwears it be aſſur'd that it is ſo, not to be led to it raſhly, or by light conjecture, but by the moſt certain Arguments:</p>
                  <p>But the other kind of Oath,<note place="margin">XVIII. What in Promiſing.</note> whereby we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe any thing, requires Truth in the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: For he that promiſes any thing, ought to be ſo minded, that when the Time comes, he truly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and fulfil his Promiſe; nor will any honeſt Man ever undertake to do, what he thinks to be againſt the moſt Holy Commandments and VVill of God: but whatſoever was lawful for him to promiſe or ſwear, he never will alter it, being once
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:63052:198"/> promis'd; unleſs by chance the Condition of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being alter'd, the things begin to be ſuch, that now if he would keep his Word and ſtand to his Promiſe, he might undergo the hatred and diſpleaſure of God. But, that Truth is neceſſary to an Oath, <hi>David</hi> alſo ſhews in theſe words;<note place="margin">Pſal. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>He that ſwears to his neighbor, and diſappoints him not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place follows <hi>Judgment:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">XIX. What it is to ſwear in Judgment.</note> for it is fit that an Oath ſhould not be taken raſhly and inconſiderately, but with good counſel and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. He therefore that is about to ſwear, ſhould firſt conſider well, whether there be any neceſſity that compels him, or not; and ſhould carefully conſider the whole matter, whether it be of ſuch a nature as ſeems to ſtand in need of an Oath. Let him moreover conſider the Time and the Place, and very many other Circumſtances; and let him not be mov'd to it by Love or Hatred, or any other violent Paſſion of the Mind; but by the quality and neceſſity of the thing it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>For without this Conſideration and diligent Attention,<note place="margin">XX. What a raſh Oath is.</note> certainly the Oath muſt needs be raſh and haſty: Of which ſort is the irreligious Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of them, who in any the moſt trivial and vain matter, without any Reaſon or Advice, burn as it were with this evil Habit.</p>
                  <p>And this almoſt every where we daily ſee done by Buyers and Sellers:<note place="margin">Obſerve and reprove.</note> For the one ſort, that they may ſell as dear as they can; and the other ſort, on the other hand, that they may buy as cheap as may be, are not afraid, even with an Oath, either to commend or diſcommend the things to be bought or ſold.</p>
                  <p>Since there is need therefore of Judgment and Prudence, <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>Ye have heard that it has been ſaid by them of old time, Thou ſhalt not forſwear thy ſelf, but ſhalt pay to the Lord all thy Oaths: But I ſay to you, Swear not at all, neither by Heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is God's Throne; neither by the Earth, becauſe it is his Footſtool; neither by Jeruſalnm, becauſe it is the City of the great King; neither ſhalt thou ſwear by thy Head, becauſe thou canſt not make one Hair white or black: but let your ſpeech be, Yea, yea, Nay, nay; for whatſoever is more than this, comes of evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For in theſe Words an Oath is not ſaid to be condemn'd generally and univerſally,<note place="margin">Anſwer'd.</note> ſince we have already ſeen, that our Lord himſelf and his Apoſtles did frequently ſwear: But our Lord would reprove the perverſe Judgment of the Jews, whereby they thought, that nothing was to be regarded in Swearing, but to beware of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They did therefore both ſwear very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly themſelves, and requir'd an Oath of others, and that in Matters very trivial and of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                  <p>For an Oath was appointed becauſe of human Frailty,<note place="margin">XXIV.

                  <p>There ſeems therefore a manifeſt Difference;<note place="margin">VIII.

                  <p>Now this Commandment of keeping Holy the Sabbath,<note place="margin">IX. This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as to time, is ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial.</note> if we conſider the appointed time, it is not fixd and conſtant, but alterable; nor does it belong to Manners, but to Ceremonies: Nor is it Natural becauſe we are not inſtructed or taught by Nature, on that Day rather than on any other, to give Worſhip to God: But from that Time when the People of Iſrael were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd from the Bondage of <hi>Pharaob,</hi> they kept Holy the Sabbath Day.</p>
                  <p>But the Time when the Obſervance of the Sabbath was to be taken away,<note place="margin">X.

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:63052:203"/> remov'd:<note place="margin">Gal. 4.10.</note> for which cauſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> when he reprov'd the Obſervers of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Rites, wrote thus: <hi>Ye obſerve Days, and Months, and Times, and Years: I am afraid of you, leſt haply I have bestow'd on you labor in vain.</hi>

                  <p>But this Commandment agrees with the reſt,<note place="margin">XI. Wherein this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment agrees with the reſt.</note> not in Rites and Ceremonies, but becauſe it has ſomething which belongs to Manners and the Law of Nature. For God's Worſhip and Religion, which is expreſs'd in this Commandment, has its Being from the Law of Nature; ſince it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to ſpend ſome Hours about thoſe things which belong to the Worſhip of God; whereof this is an Argument, That among all Nations we ſee there were certain appointed Days, and thoſe Public ones too, which were conſecrated to the performance of Sacred and Divine Matters: For it is natural to Man to allow ſome certain Time to thoſe things that are neceſſary to the diſcharge of Buſineſs, as to the Sleep and Reſt of the Body and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>And as to the Body,<note place="margin">Obſerve this Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> ſo by the ſame Natural Reaſon it is that we allow ſome Time to the Mind, that ſhe may refreſh her ſelf with Divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation: And therefore ſince there ought to be ſome part of Time for performance of Divine Matters, and giving due Worſhip to God, this belongs to the Commandments of Manners.</p>

                  <p>The Firſt therefore in general propoſes what is preſcrib'd in theſe words,<note place="margin">XIV. What the Words teach.</note> 
                     <hi>Remember that thou ſanctifie the Sabbath-day.</hi> Now for this cauſe, in the beginning of the Commandment, is that word <hi>Remember</hi> fitly added, becauſe the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of that Day belongs to Ceremonies.</p>
                  <p>Of which thing it ſeem'd the People are to be admoniſh'd;<note place="margin">Firſt.</note> ſince tho the Law of Nature teaches, that at ſome time or other God is religiouſly to be worſhip'd, yet it has not appointed any certain Day whereon this ought chiefly to be done.</p>
                  <p>Moreover,<note place="margin">Secondly.</note> the Faithful are to be taught, that from thoſe Words may be gather'd the Way and Manner how it is convenient to do Work all the Week; to wit, ſo as always to have regard to the Holy-day; on which Day ſeeing an Account is to be given to God, as it were, of our Works and Actions, it muſt needs be, that we do ſuch Works as will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be rejected by the Judgment of God, and which,<note place="margin">1 Reg. 2.5.</note> as it is written, ſhall not wound or offend our own Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">Thirdly.</note> VVe are taught, which we ought care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to obſerve, to wit, That there are not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Occaſions to make us forgetful of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, either being led by the Example of others that neglect it, or out of love to Shews and Plays, whereby we are very much led away from the holy and religious Obſervance of this Day.</p>
                  <p>And now come we to the Signification of the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> Sabbath is an <hi>Hebrew</hi> word,<note place="margin">XV. What the Sabbath is.</note> which in <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſignifies a Ceſſation; to keep Sabbath is therefore call'd in <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 23. Exod. 20.12. Deut. 5.14.</note> to ceaſe and reſt. In which Signification the Seventh day was call'd by the name of Sabbath; becauſe the whole VVorld being finiſh'd and perfected, God reſted from all his VVork which he had done: for ſo the Lord, in <hi>Exodus,</hi> calls this Day.</p>
                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:63052:204"/>

                     </label> not only this Seventh Day, but for the Dignity of that Day even the whole VVeek alſo was call'd by that name; in which ſenſe the Phariſee in S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaid;<note place="margin">Luc. 18.12.</note> 
                     <hi>I faſt twice in a Sabbath.</hi> And thus much of the Signification of <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Sanctification of the Sabbath in Sacred Scripture is a Ceſſation from all Bodily Labor and Buſineſs;<note place="margin">XVI. What it is to ſanctifie.</note> as plainly appears from theſe words of the Commandment which follow: <hi>Thou ſhalt not work.</hi> Nor do's it ſignifie that only, (for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it would be ſufficient to ſay in <hi>Deuteronomy, Obſerve the Day of the Sabbath</hi>):<note place="margin">Deut. 12.</note> But ſeeing that in the ſame Place it is added, <hi>to ſanctifie it,</hi> by this word is ſhew'd, that the Day of the Sabbath is Religious, and conſecrated to divine Actions and holy Duties</p>
                  <p>We therefore do then fully and perfectly cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Sabbath-day,<note place="margin">XVII.

Wherefore, if to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and holy Obſervance of the Sabbath, we add Works of Mercy,<note place="margin">Eſay 58.6.</note> ſurely they are many and very great Rewards, which in the ſame Chapter are propos'd to us.</p>
                  <p>The true and proper Senſe of this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therefore is,<note place="margin">XVIII.

                  <p>Now in the next part of this Commandment is ſhew'd,<note place="margin">XIX. What the ſecond Part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment requires.</note> That the Seventh day is dedicated by God to Divine Worſhip; for thus it is written; <hi>Six days ſhalt thou labor, and do all thy work; but the Seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.</hi> The meaning of which words is. That Sabbath is conſecrated to the Lord, and that on that Day we pay him our Duties of Religion, and that we know the Seventh day to be Sign of the Lord's Reſt.</p>
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:63052:204"/>
                  <p>Now this Day is dedicated to God,<note place="margin">XX.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For it is a Sign between me and you in your Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi>

                     <hi>that ye may know, that I am the Lord who ſanctifie you.</hi> It was a Sign therefore which ſhew'd, that Men ought to dedicate themſelves to God, and to keep themſelves holy to him, ſince we ſee even the very Day to be dedicated to him: for that Day is Holy, becauſe then eſpecially Men ought to exerciſe Holineſs and Religion.</p>
                  <p>And then it is a Sign and Monument,<note place="margin">The Second.</note> as it were, of the wonderful Creation of the World.</p>
                  <p>And it was moreover given as a Sign to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and warn the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>

                  <p>Now it can hardly be expreſs'd how great Advantages this Point has,<note place="margin">II. The Love of God ſhines forth in the Love of our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. 1 Joh. 6.20.</note> ſince it both bears its own fruits, and thoſe large and excellent; and is as it were a Sign, whereby the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Duty of the Firſt Commandment is apparent. <hi>He that loves not his Brother,</hi> ſays S. <hi>John, whom he ſees, how can he love God, whom he ſees not?</hi> After the ſame manner, if we do not Reverence and Honor our Parents whom we ought to love <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> to God, ſeeing they are almoſt always in our Sight, what Honor, what Worſhip will we give to God the Supream and Beſt Parent, who is above our Sight? Whence it is plain, that both Commandments agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Now the uſe of this Commandment is very large:<note place="margin">III How large this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is.</note> For beſides thoſe that have begotten us, there are many other beſides whom we ought to Honor as Parents, by reaſon either of their Power, or Dignity or Profitableneſs, or ſome other excellent Function or Office. Beſides, it eaſes the Labor of Parents and Superiors: For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their chief Care is, that thoſe whom they have in their Power, live well and agreeably to the Divine Law; this Care will be very eaſy if all Men underſtood, that even by Gods Authority and Admonition, the greateſt Honor is to be given to Parents.</p>
                  <p>Which that we may do, it is needful to know a kind of Difference between the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Firſt, and thoſe of the Second Table. Theſe things therefore are firſt to be explain'd by the Curat; and firſt of all let him Teach, That the Divine Laws of the Decalogue, were cut in Two Tables: In one of which, as we are taught by the Holy Fathers, thoſe Three
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:63052:208"/> were contain'd, which have already been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd; but the reſt were included in the other Table. <hi>Vide Clem. Alexand. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Strom. ſatis ante finem. Auguſt. in Exod. q.</hi> 71. &amp; <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 119. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>D. Thom.</hi> 1.2. <hi>q.</hi> 100. <hi>art.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>And this Deſcription was very fit for us,<note place="margin">IV. Mark this Reaſon.</note> that the very Order of the Commandments might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the Reaſon of them: For whatſoever in Sacred Scripture is commanded by the Divine Law, it ariſes from one of theſe Two Kinds: For in every Duty our Love either towards God, or towards Man is ſeen. Now the Three firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments teach our Love towards God: But that which belongs to the Conjunction and Society of Men, is contain'd in the other Seven Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. Wherefore it was not without Reaſon, that ſuch a Diſtinction was made, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> to the Firſt and others to the Laſt Table.</p>
                  <p>For in the Three firſt Commandments,<note place="margin">V. The firſt Difference betwixt the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of has bin ſpoken, God, who is the Supreme Good, is as it where the ſubject Matter which they handle; but in the reſt, the good of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor. In the Firſt is propos'd our greateſt Love, in the reſt our next Love; the Firſt reſpect their End, the reſt thoſe things that are referr'd to the End. <hi>Vide Aug. in Pſal.</hi> 32. <hi>Ser.</hi> 1. <hi>D.

                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides,<note place="margin">The ſecond difference.</note> the Love of God depends thereupon. For God is of himſelf, and not for the ſake of any other thing, to be lov'd above all things; but the Love of our Neighbor has its beginning from our Love of God, and is to be directed to it, as to a certain Rule: For if we account our Parents Dear, if we obey our Maſters, if we reverence our Betters, we muſt do it ſpecially for this Cauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is their Procreator, and would have them above others, by whoſe Labor he rules and defends the reſt. Who, ſeeing he requires it of us, to reverence ſuch kind of perſons, we ought therefore to do it to them, who by God are dignfied with this Honor: Whence it comes to
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:63052:209"/> paſs, that the Honor we have for our Parents, we ſeem to have it for God rather than for Men. For ſo it is in S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> when mention is made of Obſervance to Speriors;<note place="margin">Mat. 10.40.</note> 
                     <hi>He that receives you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives me:</hi> And the Apoſtle, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi>

                  <p>For to kill Beaſts is not forbidd'n; for if it be allow'd of God that Men ſhould be fed by them, it is but meet they be kill'd: Of which matter S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays thus, <q>When we hear, ſays he, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> we underſtand not this to be ſpoken of Fruits, becauſe they have no Senſe, nor of irrational Animals, becauſe they are joyn'd with us on no account.</q>

                  <p>If any one with his Fiſt or Foot ſtrike a Woman with Child,<note place="margin">The Firſt.</note> whereupon follows an untimely Birth. This happens indeed beyond the Deſign of the Striker; yet he is not blameleſs, becauſe it was

                  <p>The other is,<note place="margin">The Second.</note> If he careleſly and heedleſly kill any one not looking well about him.</p>
                  <p>For which cauſe alſo,<note place="margin">Sixthly.</note> if any one for defence of his own Safety, uſing all the care he can, kill another, it appears plain enough, that he is not guilty of this Law.</p>
                  <p>And theſe are the Slaughters we have now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,<note place="margin">VIII.

                  <p>If we conſider thoſe who are kill'd,<note place="margin">X. Who may not be kill'd.</note> this Law belongs to every one; nor is there any one of ſo mean and baſe a Condition, but he is defended by vertue of this Law.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it lawful for any one to kill himſelf,<note place="margin">XI. None may kill himſelf.</note> ſeeing no one has ſo much the power of his own Life, that at his own pleaſure he may kill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: And therefore by the words of this Law it is not thus appointed, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill another;</hi> but ſimply, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then if we reſpect the manifold ways of Murder,<note place="margin">XII.

Let him have the Arguments in readineſs, which thoſe Fathers devoutly us'd, they being very weighty and very ſuitable to the Matter. <hi>Vide quae citantur. n.</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p>But eſpecially theſe Three are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt is,<note place="margin">XXX. Three Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The Firſt.</note> That he that thinks he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd an Injury, ſhould be earneſtly perſwaded that he, whom he deſires to be aveng'd of, was not the principal cauſe of his loſs or Injury. So that admirable Man <hi>Job</hi> did, who being grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly aſſaulted by the <hi>Sabeans, Chaldeans</hi> and by the Devil, yet took no Regard of them; but as an upright and right pious Man, truly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly us'd theſe Words,<note place="margin">Job. 1.28.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="402" facs="tcp:63052:218"/>
                  <p>By the Words and Example of that moſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Man therefore,<note place="margin">XXXI. Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.</note> let Chriſtians perſwade themſelves, what is moſt true, that all things whatſoever we ſuffer in this Life, come from the Lord, who is the Father and Author of all Juſtice and Mercy. Nor does he puniſh us as Enemies (which is his infinite Kindneſs,) but corrects and chaſtiſes us as Sons.</p>
                  <p>Nor indeed,<note place="margin">XXXII. How they are to be accounted that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute us.</note> if we rightly conſider it, are Men in theſe caſes any other thing at all, but the Miniſters and Officers as it were of God: And tho a Man may wrongfully hate another, and wiſh him very ill; yet, unleſs by Gods Permiſſion, he can by no means hurt him. For this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>Joſeph</hi> patiently endur'd the wicked Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of his Brethren,<note place="margin">Gen. 45.8 2 Reg. 16.10.</note> ſo <hi>David</hi> did the Injuries done him by <hi>Shimei.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this Matter alſo belongs properly that kind of Argument,<note place="margin">Tom <hi>3</hi> in Hom. Quod nemo laedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur niſi a ſeipſo.</note> which S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> gravely and excellently handl'd, to wit, That none is hurt but by himſelf: For thoſe that think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be injuriouſly dealt with, if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the matter well with themſelves, will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly find that they have received no wrong or damage from others: for tho the things are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wherein they are hurt, yet they moſt of all hurt themſelves, when they wickedly pollute their Soul with Hatred, Luſt, Envy.</p>
                  <p>The Second is,<note place="margin">The ſecond Argument.</note> That it contains two ſpecial Advantages, which belong to thoſe, who being led with a pious Endeavour to pleaſe God, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgive Injuries.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt whereof is this,<note place="margin">Two Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages. The Firſt. Matth. 18.33.</note> That God has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd, that they ſhall obtain Pardon of their own Sins, that forgive others their Offences; from which Promiſe it eaſily appears, how acceptable this Office of Piety and Love is to him.</p>
                  <p>The other Advantage is,<note place="margin">The ſecond Advantage Matth. 5.46.</note> That we get a kind of Nobility and Perfection, becauſe by forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wrongs, we are made in a manner like God, <hi>Who cauſes his Sun to riſe on the Good and Bad, and rains on the Juſt and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="403" facs="tcp:63052:218"/>
                  <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">The third Argument.</note> the Diſadvantages are to be explain'd, into which we then fall, when we will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the Wrongs that are done us. Let the Curat therefore lay before the Eyes of them who cannot bring themſelvs to forgive their Enemies, not only that the Sin is grievous, but alſo that by the continuance of the Sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it grows greater.</p>
                  <p>For whereas he,<note place="margin">XXXIII. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs of Hatred.</note> whoſe Mind is thus affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thirſts after his Enemies Bloud; being full of Hope of being reveng'd on him, is Night and Day ſo imploy'd in the continual agitation of his wicked Mind, that he ſeems never to be quiet from the contriving of Murder, or ſome other heinous thing; whence it comes to paſs, that either never, or with very great Labor is he driven to it, either wholly to pardon, or at leaſt in ſome meaſure to remit Injuries.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it is rightly compar'd to a Wound, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
                     </label> wherein the Arrow ſticks faſt.</p>
                  <p>There are moreover many Inconveniences and Sins,<note place="margin">XXXIV. The attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of Hatred. 1 Joan. 2.11.</note> which are chain'd as it were to this one Sin of Hatred: And therefore S. <hi>John</hi> according to this Senſe ſpake thus, <hi>He that hates his Brother is in darkneſs, and walks in darkneſs, and knows not whither he goes, becauſe Darkneſs has blinded his Eyes:</hi> Therefore he muſt needs fall oftentimes; for how can it be, that a man can allow the Words and Actions of him whom he hates? Hence proceed raſh and unjuſt Judgments, Anger, Envy, Reviling, and ſuch like, wherein even they alſo are inſnar'd, who are related in Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or Friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it often happens that out of one Sin, <label type="milestone">

But if he undertake the Office of Interpreting the Decalogue or Ten Commandments, he ſhall ſhew, what the Diſſimilitude of theſe Two Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is, and how the one Concupiſcence or Covetouſneſs differs from the other, which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> declares in his Book of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions upon <hi>Exodus.

                  <p>Now of theſe Commandments there is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>The One,<note place="margin">IV. The neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of theſe Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The firſt Neceſſiy.</note> that the meaning of the Sixth and Seventh Commandments might be explain'd; for altho, by a kind of light of Nature, we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that the deſire of enjoying another Man's Wife is forbidd'n, becauſe Adultery is forbidden: For if it were lawful to covet, it were lawful alſo to enjoy: Yet many of the Jews were ſo blinded with Sin, that they could not be perſwaded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that this was forbid'n of God; yea tho this Law of God was publiſh'd and known, yet there were many who profeſs'd themſeves Interpreters of the Law, that were involv'd in this Error, as we may obſerve from that Speech of our Lord in S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Ye have heard that it has been ſaid by them of old time, Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery; but I ſay to you, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other neceſſity of theſe Commandments is,<note place="margin">V. The Second Neceſſity.</note> that ſome things are diſtinctly and explicitly forbidd'n, which in the Sixth and Seventh were not ſo: For, for example, the Seventh {query}Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:63052:237"/> forbids every one unjuſtly to ſeize another Mans Goods, or to endeavor to take them away: But this forbids every one ſo much as in the leaſt to covet them, altho by Right and Law he may obtain the thing, by getting whereof he ſees his Neighbor damnified.</p>
                  <p>But firſt of all,<note place="margin">VI. Why God added theſe two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments to the reſt.</note> before we come to the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Commandment, the Faithful are to be taught, That by this Law we are not only learn'd to reſtrain our Deſires, but alſo to obſerve the Love of God to us, which is infinite.</p>
                  <p>For when,<note place="margin">VII. For our ſake theſe Command<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments were added.</note> by the former Commandments of the Law, he had fenc'd us about, as it were with Walls, that no one ſhould wrong either us or ours; by this Commandment, join'd to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, he was pleas'd to provide, that we ſhould not hurt our ſelves by our own Appetites; which we might eaſily do, if we might freely and fully covet and deſire all things. By this Law there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of <hi>Not coveting,</hi> God provided, that the Spurs of Deſires, wherewith we are prick'd forward to all hurtful things, by vertue of this Law are in a manner blunted, that they ſting us the leſs, and we have therefore the longer ſpace of time to free our ſelves from the troubleſom Importunity of our Deſires, to perform thoſe many and very great Duties of Piety and Religion which we owe to God.</p>
                  <p>Nor do's this Law teach us this only;<note place="margin">VIII. God's Law is to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>God's Law therefore is as it were a kind of Looking-glaſs,<note place="margin">A ſingular Similitude.</note> wherein we may ſee the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Nature:<note place="margin">Rom. 7.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

All Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence is not here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</note> leſt haply any one ſhould think that that Concupiſcence which is indeed blameleſs, is in any meaſure a Vice, as for the Spirit to luſt againſt the Fleſh, or to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet the Juſtifications of God at all times, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing which <hi>David</hi> ſo earneſtly deſir'd; the Curat may teach, what that Concupiſcence is, which by appointment of this Law we are to ſhun.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore,<note place="margin">X. What Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence is.</note> it muſt be known, that Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence is a certain Commotion and Force of the Mind, whereby Men are provok'd to deſire thoſe delightful things which they have not.</p>
                  <p>And as the other Motions of our Minds are not always evil,<note place="margin">XI. Harmleſs Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence.</note> ſo this Force of Concupiſcence is not always to be accounted vicious; nor is it therefore ill to deſire Meat or Drink, or when we are cold, to deſire to be warm; or, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, when we are hot, to deſire to be cold.</p>
                  <p>And indeed this Power of Concupiſcence,<note place="margin">XII. Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by Sin.</note> by the Will of God, was rightly put into us by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but by the Sin of our Firſt Parents it came, that overpaſſing the Bounds of Nature, it grew ſo far deprav'd, that it oftentimes is incited to luſt after thoſe things that are againſt the Spirit and Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>And yet this Power,<note place="margin">XIII. The Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of a right Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence. The Firſt.</note> if well govern'd, and kept within its own Limits, do's oftentimes afford no ſmall Advantages.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, It makes us with earneſt Prayers to ſupplicate God, and humbly to beg of him thoſe things we moſt earneſtly deſire: For Prayer is the Interpreter of our Deſires; but if this well, order'd Power of Concupiſcence were wanting, there would not be ſo many Prayers in the Church of God.</p>
                  <pb n="442" facs="tcp:63052:238"/>
                  <p>Beſides,<note place="margin">The Second.</note> it makes God's Gifts the more dear to us: For by how much we are inflam'd with a more earneſt Deſire of any thing, by ſo much the more dear and delightful will that thing be to us, when we have gotten it.</p>
                  <p>And then<note place="margin">The Third.</note> the Delight it ſelf, which we feel from the thing deſir'd, makes us with the greater Devotion to give Thanks to God. If therefore it be lawful at any time to covet, we muſt needs confeſs, that the whole Power of Concupiſcence is not forbidden. And tho S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">Rom 7.20.</note> that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence is Sin;</hi> yet that muſt be taken in the ſame meaning in which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake,<note place="margin">Exod. 10.16.</note> whoſe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony he brings, the ſame that the Apoſtle's Words declare; for in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians</hi> he calls it,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.10.</note> the Concupiſcence of the Fleſh: <hi>Walk ye in the Spirit,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and ye ſhall not fulfil the Deſires of the Fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That natural and well-govern'd Power of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence therefore,<note place="margin">XIV.

For to this kind of Deſire the Holy Scriptures exhort us; <hi>Covet ye my Sayings;</hi> and, <hi>Come unto me, all ye that deſire me. Wiſd.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 24.26.</p>

                  <p>Or elſe becauſe tho the things themſelves were not by Nature evil, yet there is ſome other cauſe why it is evil to deſire them: Of which ſort are thoſe things which God or his Church forbids us to have, for we may not ſo much as deſire thoſe things, which it is unlawful for us to have. Such kind of things, in the Old Law, were the Gold and Silver whereof Idols had been made, which the Lord, in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 7.26.</note> forbad that any one ſhould covet.</p>
                  <p>Beſides,<note place="margin">The Third.</note> for this Reaſon this vicious Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is forbidden, becauſe thoſe things it deſires are anothers; as Houſe, Servant, Maid, Field, Wife, Ox, Aſs, and many other things; which being anothers, the Law of God forbids to covet them.</p>
                  <p>And the very Deſire of things of this kind is wicked,<note place="margin">XVIII. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence is Sin, and when it is committed.</note> and to be reckon'd among the worſt of Sins, when the Mind yields her Aſſent to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of them: For then it becomes Sin, when after the Impulſe of evil Deſires, the Mind is delighted with that which is evil, or do's not reſiſt it; as S. <hi>James,</hi> when he ſhews the Beginning and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of Sin, teaches in theſe Words:<note place="margin">Jac. 1.14.</note> 
                     <hi>Every one is tempted, being drawn away and enticed by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence. And then when Concupiſcence has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, it brings forth Sin; and Sin, when it is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, begets Death. Vide D.

                     <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet;</hi> the meaning of theſe Words is, that we reſtrain our Deſires from thoſe things which belong to others: For the Thirſt of Deſire of other Mens Things is immenſe and infinite, nor can it ever be ſatisfied; as it is written, <hi>A

                  <p>Now,<note place="margin">The Firſt.</note> the firſt Advantage which we gather from thence, is this; That we honor God in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him: For Prayer is a certain Argument of Religion, which in Sacred Scripture is compar'd to a ſweet Perfume;<note place="margin">Pſal. 140.9.</note> for, ſays <hi>David, Let my Prayer be directed in thy ſight as Incence.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by this means we profeſs our ſelves ſubject to God, whom we acknowledge and declare to be the Author of all Good; from whom only we look for Refuge and Defence, for Safety and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.

                  <p>But ſometimes it happens,<note place="margin">IV. Why God ſometimes hears not our Prayers.</note> that what we ask we obtain not of God. It is ſo: But then God takes the greateſt care of our Advantage; either becauſe he beſtows upon us other greater and larger Bleſſings, or elſe becauſe what we deſire is neither neceſſary nor profitable for us; yea, and perhaps it would be not only unneceſſary, but hurtful to us, if he ſhould give it us. For as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays, God in mercy denies us ſome things, which ſometimes in anger he grants; and ſometimes alſo we pray ſo careleſly and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, that even we our ſelves regard not what we ſay. <hi>Aug. init.

What Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is.</note> if in Prayer the Mind, which ought to be carried to God, go a wandring, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any care or devotion, we raſhly utter the Words of a Prayer; how ſhall we call this empty Noiſe of a Prayer, a Chriſtian Prayer? <hi>De Orationis definitione, vide Damaſcen. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Fide Orthod. c.</hi> 24. <hi>Aug. de Sermone Domini in Monte, c.</hi> 7. &amp; <hi>Serm.</hi> 230. <hi>de Tempore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore it is no wonder,<note place="margin">Mark this Reaſon.</note> if God give us not our Deſire ſince we prove our ſelves, by the Negligence and Ignorance of our Prayer, to be in a manner unwilling to have the thing we pray for, or elſe pray for that which would hurt us.</p>
                  <p>But,<note place="margin">VI. To thoſe that ask a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, more is given than ask'd.

And to thoſe that rightly conſider it, God heaps his Favors, not only on us that ask them, and that not only in an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Gifts, but alſo in the ſpeedy granting of them, as the Holy Scriptures ſhew, when they uſe that form of ſpeaking,<note place="margin">Pſal. 9.17.</note>

                  <p>To theſe is added another Advantage,<note place="margin">The third Advantage of Prayer.</note> that by Prayer we exerciſe and increaſe the Vertues of the Mind, and eſpecially Faith: For as they cannot Pray aright, that have not Faith in God, for it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.14.</note>

                  <p>God can indeed give us all things abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">VII.

                  <p>He will therefore have us uſe this Exerciſe of Prayer,<note place="margin">The Fifth.</note> that being intent upon the Deſire of begging what we wiſh for, we might profit ſo far by that Diligence and Deſire, that we might be made worthy, to have thoſe Gifts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd on us, which before our ſtarv'd and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

There is no ſort of Men which are not to be pray'd for.</note> the Faithful are to be taught, for whom they are to pray. Prayer contains Petition and Thankſgiving, wherefore we will firſt ſpeak concerning Petition. We muſt therefore pray for all, without any Exception, either of Differences, of Favour or of Religion: For whether he be Enemy, Stranger, or Infidel, he is our Neighbor; whom becauſe by God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand we ought to love, it follows, that we ought to make Prayers alſo for them, which is the Office of Love; for thither tends that Exhortation of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.1.</note> 
                     <hi>I beſeech you that Prayers be made for all Men.</hi>

                  <p>In the ſecond place,<note place="margin">Secondly. For Princes.</note> we muſt pray for Princes, according to the Sentence of the ſame Apoſtle: For, how great Public Good we enjoy by juſt and pious Princes, there is no one ignorant.

                  <p>There are Examples of Holy Men,<note place="margin">Thirdly, For Pious Men.</note> whereby we are admoniſh'd to pray for good and pious Men; for they alſo ſtand in need of the Prayers

Now how great a force hearty Prayers made for this kind of Men has, appears by ſo many Examples of Men of all ſorts, which God daily carries, being ſnatch'd out of the Power of Darkneſs, into the Kingdom of the Son of his Love; and of Veſſels of Wrath, he makes them Veſſels of Mercy: In which Caſe, no one in his right Mind can doubt that the Interceſſion of Devout Men prevails very much. <hi>Vide S.

                  <p>In the other part of Prayer we give the higheſt Thanks to God,<note place="margin">IV. For whom we ought to give thanks.</note> for his Divine and Immortal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, which he always did, and daily do's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon Mankind.

                  <p>Hither belongs that firſt part of the Angelical Salutation,<note place="margin">V.

Secondly, The Saints.</note> We fly to the Aſſiſtance of the Saints that are in Heaven; to whom alſo that Prayers are to be made, has been held ſo certain in the Church of God, that to pious Men there can ariſe no doubt: Which becauſe it has alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy been explain'd apart in its proper place, we remit both the Curats and others thither.</p>
                  <p>But to remove all Error of the Unlearned,<note place="margin">III. God and the Saints to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd after a different manner.</note> it will be worth the labor to teach the Faithful what difference there is in the manner of this Invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for we do not pray to God and to the Saints after the ſame manner. For we pray to God, either to give us the good things we want, or to deliver us from evil; but we pray to the Saints, becauſe they are in favor with God, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take our Patronage, and to beg of God for us thoſe things we want.</p>
                  <p>Hence we have two ways of Praying,<note place="margin">IV.

                  <head>What way is requir'd in PRAYER.</head>
                  <p>NOW it highly concerns Men how they perform their Sacred Prayers: for tho Prayer is a wholſom Good;<note place="margin">I. Prayer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs rightly perform'd, profits no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Jac. 4.3.</note> yet if it be not rightly apply'd, it profits not, <hi>For what we ask, we oftentimes do not obtain,</hi> as S. <hi>James</hi> ſays, for this Reaſon, <hi>becauſe we ask amiſs.</hi> The Curats therefore ſhall teach the Faithful what the beſt way of Praying well, both privately and publicly is, and what Rules have bin deliver'd by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt our Lord for Chriſtian Prayer.</p>
                  <p>VVe muſt therefore ask in Spirit and Truth;<note place="margin">II. We muſt pray in Spirit and in Truth. Joh. 4.23.</note> 
                     <hi>For our heavenly Father ſeeks ſuch as worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth. Of this way of praying in Spirit and in Truth, vide Cyrill. Alexandr. per</hi> 17 <hi>libros integros; item D. Thom.</hi> 2.2. <hi>q.</hi> 83. <hi>a.</hi> 12.</p>

Who prays in Spirit and Truth.</note> from which Spiritual way of Praying we exclude not the Vocal; but yet we hold, that the principal in place is of right to be given to that Prayer which proceeds from an earneſt mind, which God, to whom the ſecret Thoughts of the Heart are open, hears, altho it proceed not out of the Mouth.</p>
                  <p>He heard the inward Prayers of <hi>Anna,</hi> who was the Mother of <hi>Samuel,</hi>

                  <p>But Vocal Prayer has its proper Benefit and Neceſſity;<note place="margin">IV. Vocal Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</note> for it inflames the Intention of the Mind, and ſets on fire the Devotion of him that prays, which S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> wrote to <hi>Proba</hi> after this manner, <hi>Cap.</hi> 8, 9, 10. <q>We our ſelves more earneſtly ſtir our ſelves up ſometimes by words and other Signs to increaſe our Holy Deſires.
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:63052:252"/> VVe are ſometimes forc'd with a fervent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Soul and Devotion to expreſs our mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by words; for while our Souls exult with Joy, it is meet alſo that the Tongue rejoyce, and withal it teaches us to offer that plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sacrifice, both of Soul and Body; which that it was the Apoſtle's manner of praying, we learn from the <hi>Acts,</hi> and from the Apoſtle in many places.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe there is a two-fold way of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">V.

                     <note place="margin">IX. What it is to pray in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> 
                     <hi>enter into thy Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and having ſhut the door, pray to thy Father in ſecret, and thy Father which ſees in ſecret ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thee.</hi> That which is here call'd a Chamber, may be referr'd to the Heart of Man; into which it is not enough to enter, but it ought moreover to be ſhut, that nothing might ruſh or fly in from without, whereby the Integrity of Prayer might be violated: For then our heavenly Father, who very well ſees the Minds and ſecret Thoughts of all Men, will grant the requeſt of him that prays.</p>
                  <p>Another requiſite of Prayer is Importunity;<note place="margin">X. We muſt pray im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately. Luc. 18.23.</note> which how great force it has, the Son of God ſhews by the Example of that Judge, who, tho he neither fear'd God, nor regarded Man, yet being overcome by the Importunity and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Widow, he granted her Petition.

                     </label> who praying once or twice, unleſs they obtain what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, are weary in Prayer: For we ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be weary of this Duty, which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Chriſt our Lord and of his Apoſtle, teaches us; but if at any time our Will faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therein, let us by Prayer beg of God the Vertue of Perſeverance.</p>
                  <p>It is the Will of the Son of God,<note place="margin">XI. Our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is to be pray'd to thro Chriſt. Joh. 16.23.</note> that our Prayers come to the Father in his Name, which by his Merit and by the Grace of his Interceſſion, gets ſuch weight or efficacy, that it is granted of our Heavenly Father: For that Word which we read in S. <hi>John,</hi> is his own, <hi>Verily, verily I ſay to you, if ye ſhall ask any thing of the Father, in my name, he will give it you; hitherto ye have not ask'd any thing in my name: ask and ye ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that your joy may be full.</hi> And again,<note place="margin">Joh. 14.41.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Let us therefore imitate the ardent Intention of Holy Men,<note place="margin">XII. We muſt pray fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently.</note> which they usd in Prayer; and let us joyn Thanksgiving with Prayer, after the
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:63052:253"/> Example of the Apoſtles, who always obſerv'd this practice, as we may ſee in the Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>And to Prayer let us add Faſting and Alms-dees:<note place="margin">XIII. To make Prayer effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt be added.</note> for indeed Faſting is very nearly related to Prayer; for thoſe that are loaded with Meat and Drink, have their Mind oppreſs'd and clogg'd, that neither can they look up to God, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what they pray for. <hi>Vide hac de re Aug. in Pſal.</hi> 42. <hi>in ſine,</hi> &amp; <hi>lib. de perfect. juſtitia reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponſ.</hi> 17. <hi>item.

                  <p>The common Signification therefore of the Kingdom of God,<note place="margin">Firſt.</note> and which is frequent in the Sacred Scripture, is not only that Power which he has over all Men and Creatures in the World, but his Providence alſo, which rules and governs all things.

                     <hi>O Lord God, thou art an Almighty King: for in thy Power are all things, and there is none that can reſiſt thy Will, thou art Lord of all, nor is there any that reſiſts thy Majeſty.</hi>

                  <p>Again,<note place="margin">Secondly.</note> by the Kingdom of God, is ſignified that ſpecial and ſingular Rule of Providence, whereby God defends and takes care of pious and holy Men.

                  <p>Laſtly, let the Faithful be admoniſh'd to reſt ſatisfied in the ſimple and abſolute Will of God.</p>

                  <p>And let him ſubject his own Judgment to Gods Will, who does better for us than we can wiſh to our ſelves.</p>

For he had no need of Clothes to cover his Body, nor of a Houſe for his ſhelter, nor of Arms for his Defence, nor of Phyſick for his Health, nor of other things, the Help whereof we ſtand in need of to defend the Weakneſs and Frailty of our Nature; that Fruit which the bleſſed Tree of Life yielded, was ſufficient to him for an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Life, which ſince it never gave for any La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor of his, or his Poſterity.</p>

Among which this is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lamentable, that for our exceeding great Charges, utmoſt Labor and Sweat, we very often receive no Fruits, when the Seed we ſow turns to bad ſtanding Corn, or is choak'd with Weeds,
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:63052:272"/> or is ſtricken with Storms, Winds, Hail, Blaſts, Cankers, and ſo periſhes and is deſtroy'd; ſo that all the whole Labor of the Year in a ſhort Time, by ſome Calamity of the Air or Earth, comes to nothing: And this happens for our Wickedneſs, at which God being angry, does not bleſs our Labors. But that dreadful Sentence remains, which at firſt he pronounc'd againſt us. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.</p>

                  <p>The Curats therefore ſhall teach,<note place="margin">XI.

                  <p>They will imitate that Prodigal Son,<note place="margin">An Example Luc. 15.</note> who when in a far Country he began to want, nor was there any one that would give him ſo much as Peas-husks to eat, when he was hungry, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards to himſelf, he underſtood that there was no Remedy to be expected any where for thoſe Evils wherewith he was preſs'd, but from his Father.</p>

How Faith given to them that pray.</note> if in their Minds they conſider the Divine Goodneſs, that his Fatherly Ears are always open to the Voice of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; for while he exhorts us to ſeek our Bread, he promiſes that he will beſtow it abundantly
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:63052:273"/> upon them that rightly ask it of him: for by teaching us how to ask it, he exhorts us to ask it; by exhorting, he inforces us to ask it; by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing us to ask, he promiſes to give it; by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to give it us, he leads us into a certain Hope of obtaining it.</p>
                  <p>The Minds of the Faithful therefore being ſtirr'd up and inflam'd,<note place="margin">XIII. What we pray for in this Petition.</note> it now follows, that we ſhew what is pray'd for in this Petition; and Firſt, what Bread that is, which here we ask.</p>

For before we pray to be deliver'd from Evil, he would have us to pray, That God's Name may be ſanctified, that his Kingdom may come, and the reſt; whereby, as by certain Steps, we come at laſt to this: But ſome there are, that if

                     <hi>Seek ye firſt the Kingdom of God.</hi>

                  <p>To this excellent way of Praying,<note place="margin">VIII. The evil Prayers of Infidels.</note> and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Example of the Prophet, the Faithful are to be incited, and to be taught how much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is between the Prayers of Infidels and thoſe of Chriſtians. They alſo pray God heartily to recover of their Diſeaſes and Wounds, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd from their preſſing and imminent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; but yet they put their ſpecial Hope of that Deliverance in the Remedies prepar'd either by Nature, or the Induſtry of Men; yea, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Religion, they uſe any Medicin given them by any one, tho made by Inchantment, Witchcraft, or the help of the Devil, ſo that they have but any hope of Recovery thereby.</p>
                  <p>But the way of Chriſtians is far otherwiſe,<note place="margin">IX. The Prayers of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> who, when they are in any Sickneſs or Adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, have God for their Higheſt Refuge and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Health; they have Him only for the Author of all their Good, and own and worſhip Him for their Deliverer, and certainly reckon, that all the Vertue of Healing that is in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins, is given them of God; and that they are profitable to the Sick only ſo far as God pleaſes. For Medicin is given of God to Mankind, to heal
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:63052:290"/> their Sickneſſes;<note place="margin">Eccl. 38.</note> hence is that Saying of <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticus The moſt High created Medicins out of the Earth, and he that is prudent will not abhor them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They therefore that have given their Name to Chriſt, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> put not their higheſt Hope of the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Health in thoſe Remedies; but truſt moſt in God, the Author of thoſe Medicins.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore in Sacred Scripture they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd,<note place="margin">X. We muſt not uſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies. 2 Chron. 16.</note> who thro confidence of the Medicins ſeek no help of God; yea, they that lead their Life according to God's Laws, abſtain from all Remedies whatſoever, which it is manifeſt are not appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God; and if by the uſe of thoſe Medicins they might have certain Hope of Recovery, yet they would abhor them as the Enchantments and Artifices of the Devil.</p>
                  <p>But the Faithful muſt be exhorted to put their Confidence in God;<note place="margin">XI. In Sickneſs we muſt truſt in God only.</note> for, for that Reaſon our moſt bountiful Father has commanded us to beg of him Deliverance from Evils, that becauſe he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it, therefore we ſhould have hope of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining. In Sacred Scripture there are many Examples of this Matter, that they who are not led by Reaſon, may be compell'd to have Hope and Confidence by a multitude of Examples: Among whom, <hi>Abraham, Jacob, Loth, Joſeph, David,</hi> are ſufficient Witneſſes of God's Goodneſs. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures of the New Teſtament reckon up ſo many that have been deliver'd out of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Difficulties by the prevalency of devout Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that the thing wants not the Proof of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>
                  <p>We will therefore content our ſelves with that one Sentence of the Prophet, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Of this ſort there are innumerable Prayers of the Saints,<note place="margin">V. Of what kind the Prayers of Saints are.</note> the Beginning of which are full of Fear, but the End full fraught with good Hope and Joy; but it is wonderful how <hi>David</hi>'s Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers excel in this reſpect; for when being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with Fear, he began to pray thus,<note place="margin">Pſal. 3.3.</note> 
                     <hi>Many there are that riſe up againſt me, and many there are that ſay to my Soul, there is no Salvation for him in his God;</hi> a little after being ſomewhat confirm'd, he ſubjoyns, <hi>tho thouſands of the People came about me, I will not fear.</hi> And in another Pſalm, when he had bewail'd his Miſeries and at laſt having put his Confidence in God, he rejoyces incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, in the Hope of eternal Bliſs, and he ſays,<note place="margin">Pſal 4.8.</note> 
                     <hi>For that very thing I will ſleep and reſt in peace.</hi>

                     <hi>Lord rebuke me not in thy Fury, neither correct me in thy Anger,</hi> with how great Trembling and Horror muſt we believe that the Prophet ſaid this?</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, with how confident and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Soul did he utter that which preſently follows?<note place="margin">Pſal. 33.3.</note> 
                     <hi>Depart from me,</hi> ſays he, <hi>all ye that work Iniquity, becauſe the Lord has heard the voice of my weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> But when he was afraid of <hi>Sauls</hi> Anger and Fury, how lowly and humbly did he implore
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:63052:293"/> Gods Help, <hi>Save me O Lord, for thy Names ſake, and judg me in thy Strength;</hi> and yet in the ſame Pſalm, he cheerfully and confidently ſubjoyns, <hi>For behold God helps me, and the Lord is the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder of my Soul.</hi>

                     </note> there are many Seeds as it were of thoſe Rules and Meditations which we before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
                  <p>And indeed this Hebrew Word was ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in our Saviours Mouth,<note place="margin">VIII. What it properly ſignifies.</note> that it pleaſed the Holy Ghoſt to have it ſtill kept in the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>The meaning of which Word in a manner is this, <hi>Know thou that thy Prayers are heard;</hi> for it has the Effect of Gods anſwering, and ſending him away with his good Grace, after that by Prayer he has obtain'd what he deſir'd.</p>

                  <p>Now this Word <hi>Amen</hi> is indeed variouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by many:<note place="margin">X.
